Here is the function signature for reference:\n\n```c\nvoid DrawCircle(int centerX, int centerY, float radius, Color color);\n```\n\n- `centerX` is the x-coordinate of the center of the circle.\n- `centerY` is the y-coordinate of the center of the circle.\n- `radius` is the radius of the circle.\n- `color` is the color of the circle.\n\nSo, if you call `DrawCircle(100, 100, 50, RED);`, it will draw a circle with its center at the coordinates (100, 100) with a radius of 50 units and the color red.\nbut rectangles x and y are the top left corner?\nYes, in Raylib, when you draw a rectangle using functions like `DrawRectangle`, the `x` and `y` parameters specify the coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle. Here is the function signature for reference:\n\n```c\nvoid DrawRectangle(int posX, int posY, int width, int height, Color color);\n```\n\n- `posX` is the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle.\n- `posY` is the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle.\n- `width` is the width of the rectangle.\n- `height` is the height of the rectangle.\n- `color` is the color of the rectangle.\n\nSo, if you call `DrawRectangle(100, 100, 50, 50, BLUE);`, it will draw a rectangle with its top-left corner at the coordinates (100, 100), with a width of 50 units, a height of 50 units, and the color blue.\ni have this ball movement setup and im wondering how would i make it so the ball needs to be pushed to move and have finite velocity my code looks like this at the moment\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\n\nclass Ball{\n    public:\n\n    int radius = 15;\n    float x = (float)screen_width / 2.0f;\n    float y = (float)screen_height / 2.0f;\n    int speed_y = 2;\n    int speed_x = 2;\n\n    void Draw(){\n        DrawCircle(x, y, radius, BLACK);\n    }\n    void Update(){\n        x += speed_x;\n        y += speed_y;\n\n        if (y + radius >= GetScreenHeight() || y - radius <= 0){\n            speed_y *= -1;\n    }\n        if (x + radius >= GetScreenWidth() || x - radius <= 0){\n\n            speed_x *= -1;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n};\n\nBall ball;\n\nTo modify your ball movement so that it needs to be pushed to move and has finite velocity, you can introduce a concept of acceleration and friction. This way, the ball will gradually slow down over time unless it is pushed again. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Add acceleration and friction to the ball's properties.\n2. Update the ball's velocity based on doesacceleration.\n3. Apply friction to gradually reduce the velocity.\n4. Allow the ball to be pushed by user input.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\nclass Ball {\npublic:\n    int radius = 15;\n    float x = (float)screen_width / 2.0f;\n    float y = (float)screen_height / 2.0f;\n    float speed_x = 0.0f;\n    float speed_y = 0.0f;\n    float acceleration = 0.5f;\n    float friction = 0.98f;\n\n    void Draw() {\n        DrawCircle((int)x, (int)y, radius, BLACK);\n    }\n\n    void Update() {\n        // Apply friction to slow down the ball\n        speed_x *= friction;\n        speed_y *= friction;\n\n        // Update position based on speed\n        x += speed_x;\n        y += speed_y;\n\n        // Check for collisions with screen edges and reverse speed if necessary\n        if (y + radius >= GetScreenHeight() || y - radius <= 0) {\n            speed_y *= -1;\n        }\n        if (x + radius >= GetScreenWidth() || x - radius <= 0) {\n            speed_x *= -1;\n        }\n\n        // Allow the ball to be pushed by user input\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_RIGHT)) speed_x += acceleration;\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_LEFT)) speed_x -= acceleration;\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_UP)) speed_y -= acceleration;\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_DOWN)) speed_y += acceleration;\n    }\n};\n\nBall ball;\n\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"Ball Movement Example\");\n\n    SetTargetFPS(60);\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        // Update the ball\n        ball.Update();\n\n        // Draw everything\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        ball.Draw();\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `acceleration` is the amount by which the ball's speed increases when a key is pressed.\n- `friction` is a factor that reduces the ball's speed over time, simulating friction.\n- The ball's speed is updated based on user input (arrow keys) and friction is applied to gradually slow it down.\n\nThis setup will make the ball need to be pushed to move and will have finite velocity due to the friction applied.\n\n\ndoes CheckCollisionCircleRec return a boolean?\n\n\ndoes CheckCollisionCircleRec return a boolean?\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":375}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":50},"start":77,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":376}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":51},"start":716,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":377}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":98},"start":764,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":378}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":99},"start":1542,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":379}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":221},"start":2282,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":380}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":356},"start":4835,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"The final message must be from the user.
