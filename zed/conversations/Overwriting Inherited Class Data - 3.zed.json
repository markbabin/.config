This will effectively overwrite the inherited data or behavior with the new definitions provided in the subclass.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\nclass ParentClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = \"Parent Data\"\n    \n    def display_data(self):\n        print(self.data)\n\nclass ChildClass(ParentClass):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.data = \"Child Data\"  # This will override the data attribute from ParentClass\n\n    def display_data(self):\n        print(self.data)  # This will override the display_data method from ParentClass\n\n# Usage\nparent = ParentClass()\nparent.display_data()  # Output: Parent Data\n\nchild = ChildClass()\nchild.display_data()  # Output: Child Data\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The `ChildClass` inherits from `ParentClass`.\n- The `data` attribute in `ChildClass` overrides the `data` attribute from `ParentClass`.\n- The `display_data` method in `ChildClass` overrides the `display_data` method from `ParentClass`.\n\nWhen you create an instance of `ChildClass` and call `display_data`, it uses the overridden `data` attribute and `display_data` method from `ChildClass`.\nso the class that inherits another class will have all the code inside the inherited class\n\nYes, when a class inherits from another class, it gains access to all the attributes and methods of the parent class. This means that the subclass will have all the code (attributes and methods) from the parent class, unless it overrides specific attributes or methods.\n\nHere's a more detailed example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\nclass ParentClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.parent_data = \"Parent Data\"\n    \n    def parent_method(self):\n        print(\"This is a method in the ParentClass\")\n\nclass ChildClass(ParentClass):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the constructor of ParentClass\n        self.child_data = \"Child Data\"  # Additional attribute specific to ChildClass\n    \n    def child_method(self):\n        print(\"This is a method in the ChildClass\")\n\n# Usage\nparent = ParentClass()\nprint(parent.parent_data)  # Output: Parent Data\nparent.parent_method()     # Output: This is a method in the ParentClass\n\nchild = ChildClass()\nprint(child.parent_data)   # Output: Parent Data (inherited from ParentClass)\nprint(child.child_data)    # Output: Child Data (specific to ChildClass)\nchild.parent_method()      # Output: This is a method in the ParentClass (inherited method)\nchild.child_method()       # Output: This is a method in the ChildClass (specific to ChildClass)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `ParentClass` has an attribute `parent_data` and a method `parent_method`.\n- `ChildClass` inherits from `ParentClass`, so it has access to `parent_data` and `parent_method`.\n- `ChildClass` also has its own attribute `child_data` and method `child_method`.\n\nWhen you create an instance of `ChildClass`, it has access to both the inherited attributes and methods from `ParentClass` as well as its own attributes and methods. This demonstrates how inheritance allows a subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of a parent class.\ncan you see my code\nI'm sorry, but I can't see your code directly.

Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Redefinition of the `Goal` class**: You have defined the `Goal` class in both `goal1.h` and `goal2.h`. This is not necessary and can cause conflicts. You should define the `Goal` class in one header file and include that header file wherever needed.\n\n2. **Variable shadowing**: In `Goal2`, you are redefining the `y` variable. This can cause confusion and may not work as expected. Instead, you should override the constructor to set the `y` value.\n\n3. **Initialization of `Goal2`**: You should properly initialize the `Goal2` class to set the `y` value.\n\nHere is a corrected version of your code:\n\n**goal.h** (Define the `Goal` class here)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\nclass Goal {\npublic:\n    int width = 240;\n    int height = 40;\n    int x = (screen_width / 2) - (width / 2);\n    int y = 760;\n\n    virtual void Draw() {\n        DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, ORANGE);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**goal1.h** (Include the `Goal` class and define `goal1`)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"goal.h\"\n\nGoal goal1;\n```\n\n**goal2.h** (Include the `Goal` class and define `Goal2` and `goal2`)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"goal.h\"\n\nclass Goal2 : public Goal {\npublic:\n    Goal2() {\n        y = 40; // Set the y value for Goal2\n    }\n\n    void Draw() override {\n        DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, ORANGE);\n    }\n};\n\nGoal2 goal2;\n```\n\n**main.cpp** (Include the necessary headers and use `goal1` and `goal2`)\n```cpp\n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"goal1.h\"\n#include \"goal2.h\"\n\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"Inheritance Example\");\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n        goal1.Draw();\n        goal2.Draw();\n\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n- The `Goal` class is defined in `goal.h`.\n- `goal1.h` includes `goal.h` and defines `goal1`.\n- `goal2.h` includes `goal.h`, defines the `Goal2` class, and defines `goal2`.\n- The `Goal2` class overrides the `Draw` method and sets the `y` value in its constructor.\n- The `main.cpp` file includes the necessary headers and uses `goal1` and `goal2`.\n\nThis should ensure that both `goal1` and `goal2` are drawn correctly.\nim sorry i accidentaly copied the first goal on goal2 lets focus on redefining y how should i do this properly this is the only var that needs to be change out of the inherited code\nNo problem! If you only need to change the `y` variable in the `Goal2` class while keeping the rest of the inherited code the same, you can do this by overriding the constructor of the `Goal2` class and setting the `y` value there. You don't need to redefine the `y` variable in the `Goal2` class; instead, you can set it in the constructor.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n**goal.h** (Define the `Goal` class here)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\nclass Goal {\npublic:\n    int width = 240;\n    int height = 40;\n    int x = (screen_width / 2) - (width / 2);\n    int y = 760;\n\n    virtual void Draw() {\n        DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, ORANGE);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**goal1.h** (Include the `Goal` class and define `goal1`)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"goal.h\"\n\nGoal goal1;\n```\n\n**goal2.h** (Include the `Goal` class and define `Goal2` and `goal2`)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"goal.h\"\n\nclass Goal2 : public Goal {\npublic:\n    Goal2() {\n        y = 40; // Set the y value for Goal2\n    }\n};\n\nGoal2 goal2;\n```\n\n**main.cpp** (Include the necessary headers and use `goal1` and `goal2`)\n```cpp\n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"goal1.h\"\n#include \"goal2.h\"\n\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"Inheritance Example\");\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n        goal1.Draw();\n        goal2.Draw();\n\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n- The `Goal` class is defined in `goal.h`.\n- `goal1.h` includes `goal.h` and defines `goal1`.\n- `goal2.h` includes `goal.h`, defines the `Goal2` class, and defines `goal2`.\n- The `Goal2` class sets the `y` value in its constructor.\n- The `main.cpp` file includes the necessary headers and uses `goal1` and `goal2`.\n\nThis way, the `Goal2` class inherits all the attributes and methods from the `Goal` class, but it changes the `y` value to 40 in its constructor. When you call `goal2.Draw()`, it will use the updated `y` value.\nis this correct \n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"goal1.h\"\n\nclass Goal2: public Goal{\n\n public:\n Goal2() {\n     y = 40;\n }\n};\nGoal2 goal2;\n\n\nYes, the code you provided is correct for defining the `Goal2` class that inherits from `Goal` and changes the `y` value. However, you should ensure that you include the necessary header guards or `#pragma once` directive to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file. Additionally, make sure that the `Goal` class is properly defined in a separate header file that both `goal1.h` and `goal2.h` can include.\n\nHere's a complete example with all the necessary files:\n\n**goal.h** (Define the `Goal` class here)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\nclass Goal {\npublic:\n    int width = 240;\n    int height = 40;\n    int x = (screen_width / 2) - (width / 2);\n    int y = 760;\n\n    virtual void Draw() {\n        DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, ORANGE);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**goal1.h** (Include the `Goal` class and define `goal1`)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"goal.h\"\n\nGoal goal1;\n```\n\n**goal2.h** (Include the `Goal` class and define `Goal2` and `goal2`)\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"goal.h\"\n\nclass Goal2 : public Goal {\npublic:\n    Goal2() {\n        y = 40; // Set the y value for Goal2\n    }\n};\n\nGoal2 goal2;\n```\n\n**main.cpp** (Include the necessary headers and use `goal1` and `goal2`)\n```cpp\n#include \"include/raylib.h\"\n#include \"goal1.h\"\n#include \"goal2.h\"\n\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"Inheritance Example\");\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n        goal1.Draw();\n        goal2.Draw();\n\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n- `goal.h` defines the `Goal` class.\n- `goal1.h` includes `goal.h` and defines an instance of `Goal` named `goal1`.\n- `goal2.h` includes `goal.h`, defines the `Goal2` class that inherits from `Goal`, and defines an instance of `Goal2` named `goal2`.\n- `main.cpp` includes `goal1.h` and `goal2.h`, and uses the `goal1` and `goal2` instances to draw the goals.\n\nThis should ensure that both `goal1` and `goal2` are drawn correctly, with `goal2` having its `y` value set t\n\ncan i write include like this #include \"ball.h\", \"head.h\" with commas instead of writitng them in different lines\n\n\ncan i write include like this #include \"ball.h\", \"head.h\" with commas instead of writitng them in different lines\n\nNo, you cannot include multiple header files in a single `#include` directive using commas. Each `#include` directive should include only one header file. You need to write each `#include` directive on a separate line.\n\nHere is the correct way to include multiple header files:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"ball.h\"\n#include \"head.h\"\n```\n\nEach `#include` directive tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the specified header file at that point in the code. Combining them with commas is not valid syntax in C++.\n\nIf you have multiple headers to include, you must list each one on a separate line as shown above.\nwhat does the n/64k at the top right of your chat in zed\nThe \"n/64k\" indicator at the top right of the chat in Zed (or similar text editors) typically represents the current position of the cursor in the file and the total size of the file in kilobytes. Here's a breakdown of what it means:\n\n- `n`: This represents the current position of the cursor in the file, usually in terms of the number of characters from the beginning of the file.\n- `64k`: This represents the total size of the file in kilobytes (KB).\n\nFor example, if you see \"123/64k\", it means that the cursor is currently at the 123rd character in a file that is 64 kilobytes in size.\n\nThis kind of indicator is useful for quickly understanding your position within a file and the overall size of the file you are working on.\nhey claude\nHello! How can I help you today?\nhow would i implement a ball that collides with a rectangle with raylib in c++\n\nHere's an example of how to implement ball-rectangle collision using Raylib in C++. I'll break it down into steps:\n\n```cpp\nclass Ball {\npublic:\n    Vector2 position;\n    float radius;\n    Vector2 speed;\n    \n    Ball() {\n        position = { (float)GetScreenWidth()/2, (float)GetScreenHeight()/2 };\n        radius = 10;\n        speed = { 5.0f, 5.0f };  // x and y speed\n    }\n\n    void Update() {\n        // Move the ball\n        position.x += speed.x;\n        position.y += speed.y;\n\n        // Bounce off screen edges\n        if (position.x >= GetScreenWidth() || position.x <= 0) speed.x *= -1;\n        if (position.y >= GetScreenHeight() || position.y <= 0) speed.y *= -1;\n    }\n\n    void Draw() {\n        DrawCircle(position.x, position.y, radius, WHITE);\n    }\n\n    Rectangle GetBoundingBox() {\n        return Rectangle{ \n            position.x - radius, \n            position.y - radius, \n            radius * 2, \n            radius * 2 \n        };\n    }\n};\n\nclass Paddle {\npublic:\n    Rectangle rect;\n\n    Paddle() {\n        rect = { \n            GetScreenWidth()/2.0f,  // x position\n            GetScreenHeight() - 50,  // y position\n            100,                     // width\n            20                       // height\n        };\n    }\n\n    void Draw() {\n        DrawRectangleRec(rect, RED);\n    }\n};\n\n// In your main game loop:\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(800, 600, \"Ball-Rectangle Collision\");\n    SetTargetFPS(60);\n\n    Ball ball;\n    Paddle paddle;\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        // Update\n        ball.Update();\n\n        // Check for collision\n        if (CheckCollisionRecs(ball.GetBoundingBox(), paddle.rect)) {\n            // Reverse ball direction on collision\n            ball.speed.y *= -1;\n            \n            // Optional: Adjust ball position to prevent sticking\n            if (ball.speed.y > 0) {\n                ball.position.y = paddle.rect.y - ball.radius;\n            } else {\n                ball.position.y = paddle.rect.y + paddle.rect.height + ball.radius;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Draw\n        BeginDrawing();\n            ClearBackground(BLACK);\n            ball.Draw();\n            paddle.Draw();\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nKey points about this implementation:\n\n1. Ball collision is handled by converting the ball into a rectangular bounding box using `GetBoundingBox()`\n\n2. Raylib's `CheckCollisionRecs()` function is used to detect collisions between rectangles\n\n3. When a collision occurs:\n   - The ball's vertical direction (speed.y) is reversed\n   - The ball's position is adjusted to prevent it from getting stuck inside the paddle\n\n4. You can add more sophisticated collision response by:\n   - Changing the ball's direction based on where it hits the paddle\n   - Adding velocity changes\n   - Adding sound effects\n   - Adding particle effects\n\nTo make it more interesting, you could:\n\n```cpp\n// Add paddle movement\nvoid Paddle::Update() {\n    if (IsKeyDown(KEY_LEFT)) rect.x -= 5.0f;\n    if (IsKeyDown(KEY_RIGHT)) rect.x += 5.0f;\n    \n    // Keep paddle on screen\n    if (rect.x < 0) rect.x = 0;\n    if (rect.x + rect.width > GetScreenWidth()) \n        rect.x = GetScreenWidth() - rect.width;\n}\n\n// Add angle changes based on where ball hits paddle\nif (CheckCollisionRecs(ball.GetBoundingBox(), paddle.rect)) {\n    // Calculate hit position relative to paddle center\n    float hitPos = (ball.position.x - paddle.rect.x) / paddle.rect.width;\n    \n    // Change angle based on hit position (-1.0 to 1.0)\n    float angle = (hitPos - 0.5f) * PI;\n    \n    float speed = sqrt(ball.speed.x * ball.speed.x + \n                      ball.speed.y * ball.speed.y);\n    \n    ball.speed.x = sin(angle) * speed;\n    ball.speed.y = -cos(angle) * speed;\n}\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic framework that you can build upon. You can add scoring, multiple balls, different types of collisions, or whatever features your game needs!\n#pragma once\n\nnamespace snake\n{\n\nclass Drawable\n{\n  public:\n\tvirtual ~Drawable() = default;\n\tvirtual void Draw() const = 0;\n};\n\n} // namespace snake\nwhat is this\nThis is a C++ abstract base class (interface) declaration. Let's break it down:\n\n1. `#pragma once` - This is a header guard that prevents multiple inclusions of this header file\n\n2. `namespace snake` - This declares a namespace called \"snake\" which helps avoid naming conflicts\n\n3. `class Drawable` - This declares an abstract base class called \"Drawable\"\n\n4. `virtual ~Drawable() = default;` - This is a virtual destructor that's defaulted\n   - Virtual destructor ensures proper cleanup when derived classes are deleted through base class pointers\n   - `= default` tells the compiler to generate the default destructor\n\n5. `virtual void Draw() const = 0;` - This is a pure virtual function\n   - `virtual` means it can be overridden by derived classes\n   - `= 0` makes it a pure virtual function\n   - `const` means the function won't modify the object's state\n   - This makes `Drawable` an abstract class that can't be instantiated directly\n\nThis is a common pattern in C++ for creating interfaces. Any class that inherits from `Drawable` must implement the `Draw()` function. Example usage:\n\n```cpp\nclass Ball : public snake::Drawable {\npublic:\n    // Must implement Draw() because Ball inherits from Drawable\n    void Draw() const override {\n        // Drawing code here\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis pattern is useful for:\n- Creating a common interface for different objects that need to be drawn\n- Enabling polymorphic behavior (treating different derived classes through the same base class interface)\n- Enforcing that all derived classes implement certain functionality (in this case, Draw)\ni have raylib setup like this /Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko/ and in there i have a 3rd folder and a decko folder. 3rd folder contains raylib folder and decko is split into src and include. how do i write neccesary makefiles so i can build the project\nTo set up a Makefile for your project, you need to specify the source files, include directories, and library directories. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a Makefile for your project structure:\n\nAssuming your project structure is as follows:\n```\n/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko/\n    3rd/\n        raylib/\n            include/\n            src/\n            ...\n    decko/\n        src/\n            main.cpp\n            ...\n        include/\n            ...\n```\n\n### Step 1: Create a Makefile in the `decko` directory\n\nNavigate to the `decko` directory and create a file named `Makefile`.\n\n### Step 2: Define variables in the Makefile\n\nDefine the necessary variables for your project, such as the compiler, source files, include directories, and library directories.\n\n```makefile\n# Compiler\nCXX = g++\n\n# Directories\nSRC_DIR = src\nINC_DIR = include\nRAYLIB_DIR = ../3rd/raylib\n\n# Source files\nSRC_FILES = $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/*.cpp)\n\n# Output executable\nTARGET = decko\n\n# Compiler flags\nCXXFLAGS = -I$(INC_DIR) -I$(RAYLIB_DIR)/include\n\n# Linker flags\nLDFLAGS = -L$(RAYLIB_DIR)/src -lraylib -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the build rules\n\nDefine the rules for building the project. The default rule should build the target executable.\n\n```makefile\n# Default rule\nall: $(TARGET)\n\n# Rule to build the target executable\n$(TARGET): $(SRC_FILES)\n\t$(CXX) $(SRC_FILES) -o $(TARGET) $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)\n\n# Clean rule to remove the built files\nclean:\n\trm -f $(TARGET)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Build the project\n\nNavigate to the `decko` directory in your terminal and run the `make` command to build the project.\n\n```sh\ncd /Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko\nmake\n```\n\n### Full Makefile Example\n\nHere is the complete Makefile:\n\n```makefile\n# Compiler\nCXX = g++\n\n# Directories\nSRC_DIR = src\nINC_DIR = include\nRAYLIB_DIR = ../3rd/raylib\n\n# Source files\nSRC_FILES = $(wildcard $(SRC_DIR)/*.cpp)\n\n# Output executable\nTARGET = decko\n\n# Compiler flags\nCXXFLAGS = -I$(INC_DIR) -I$(RAYLIB_DIR)/include\n\n# Linker flags\nLDFLAGS = -L$(RAYLIB_DIR)/src -lraylib -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo\n\n# Default rule\nall: $(TARGET)\n\n# Rule to build the target executable\n$(TARGET): $(SRC_FILES)\n\t$(CXX) $(SRC_FILES) -o $(TARGET) $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)\n\n# Clean rule to remove the built files\nclean:\n\trm -f $(TARGET)\n```\n\nThis Makefile should allow you to build your project by running the `make` command in the `decko` directory. It compiles all `.cpp` files in the `src` directory, includes headers from both the `include` directory and the Raylib `include` directory, and links against the Raylib library and necessary frameworks.\n\nis the \n\n\nis the name of the makefile important ive seen it called  CMakeLists.txt\nThe name of the file is indeed important, but it depends on the build system you are using.\n\n1. **Makefile**: If you are using the traditional `make` build system, the file should be named `Makefile`. This is the default name that `make` looks for when you run the `make` command.\n\n2. **CMakeLists.txt**: If you are using CMake, the file should be named `CMakeLists.txt`. CMake is a more modern and powerful build system that generates platform-specific build files (like Makefiles, Visual Studio project files, etc.) from a higher-level configuration.\n\n### Using Makefile\n\nIf you are using a Makefile, the file should be named `Makefile` and you can use the example provided in the previous response.\n\n### Using CMake\n\nIf you prefer to use CMake, you need to create a `CMakeLists.txt` file. Here is an example of how you can set up a `CMakeLists.txt` for your project:\n\n#### Project Structure\n```\n/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko/\n    3rd/\n        raylib/\n            include/\n            src/\n            ...\n    decko/\n        src/\n            main.cpp\n            ...\n        include/\n            ...\n```\n\n#### CMakeLists.txt\n\nCreate a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `decko` directory:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\n\n# Project name\nproject(decko)\n\n# Set C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)\n\n# Include directories\ninclude_directories(include)\ninclude_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../3rd/raylib/include)\n\n# Source files\nfile(GLOB SOURCES \"src/*.cpp\")\n\n# Add executable\nadd_executable(decko ${SOURCES})\n\n# Link libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(decko ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../3rd/raylib/src/libraylib.a)\ntarget_link_libraries(decko -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo)\n```\n\n### Building with CMake\n\n1. **Navigate to the `decko` directory**:\n   ```sh\n   cd /Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a build directory**:\n   ```sh\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   ```\n\n3. **Run CMake to generate the build files**:\n   ```sh\n   cmake ..\n   ```\n\n4. **Build the project**:\n   ```sh\n   make\n   ```\n\n### Summary\n\n- If you are using `make`, name the file `Makefile`.\n- If you are using CMake, name the file `CMakeLists.txt`.\n\nBoth systems have their own advantages. `make` is simpler and more straightforward for small projects, while CMake is more powerful and flexible, especially for larger projects or projects that need to be built on multiple platforms.\nshould i make the cmake file in decko or decko/decko\nYou should create the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root of your project directory, which in your case is `decko`. This way, the CMake configuration will be able to properly reference the `src` and `include` directories within the `decko` directory.\n\nHere's how your project structure should look:\n\n```\n/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko/\n    3rd/\n        raylib/\n            include/\n            src/\n            ...\n    decko/\n        src/\n            main.cpp\n            ...\n        include/\n            ...\n    CMakeLists.txt\n```\n\n### CMakeLists.txt\n\nCreate the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `decko` directory:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\n\n# Project name\nproject(decko)\n\n# Set C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)\n\n# Include directories\ninclude_directories(decko/include)\ninclude_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../3rd/raylib/include)\n\n# Source files\nfile(GLOB SOURCES \"decko/src/*.cpp\")\n\n# Add executable\nadd_executable(decko ${SOURCES})\n\n# Link libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(decko ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../3rd/raylib/src/libraylib.a)\ntarget_link_libraries(decko -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo)\n```\n\n### Building with CMake\n\n1. **Navigate to the `decko` directory**:\n   ```sh\n   cd /Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a build directory**:\n   ```sh\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   ```\n\n3. **Run CMake to generate the build files**:\n   ```sh\n   cmake ..\n   ```\n\n4. **Build the project**:\n   ```sh\n   make\n   ```\n\nwdwdawd### Summary\n\ni created a main.cpp file in decko/decko/source and the second i write include raylib it says it cant find it why\n\nThe issue you're encountering is likely due to the include paths not being correctly set up in your `CMakeLists.txt` file. When you include a header file like `#include \"raylib.h\"`, the compiler needs to know where to find that file.\n\nLet's ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` file is correctly set up to include the Raylib headers. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\n/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko/\n    3rd/\n        raylib/\n            include/\n                raylib.h\n            src/\n                libraylib.a\n            ...\n    decko/\n        source/\n            main.cpp\n            ...\n        include/\n            ...\n    CMakeLists.txt\n```\n\n### CMakeLists.txt\n\nEnsure your `CMakeLists.txt` file is correctly set up to include the Raylib headers and link against the Raylib library:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\n\n# Project name\nproject(decko)\n\n# Set C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)\n\n# Include directories\ninclude_directories(decko/include)\ninclude_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../3rd/raylib/include)\n\n# Source files\nfile(GLOB SOURCES \"decko/source/*.cpp\")\n\n# Add executable\nadd_executable(decko ${SOURCES})\n\n# Link libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(decko ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../3rd/raylib/src/libraylib.a)\ntarget_link_libraries(decko -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo)\n```\n\n### main.cpp\n\nIn your `main.cpp` file, you should be able to include the Raylib header like this:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialization\n    InitWindow(800, 600, \"Raylib Example\");\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawText(\"Hello, Raylib!\", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Building with CMake\n\n1. **Navigate to the `decko` directory**:\n   ```sh\n   cd /Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/decko\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a build directory**:\n   ```sh\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   ```\n\n3. **Run CMake to generate the build files**:\n   ```sh\n   cmake ..\n   ```\n\n4. **Build the project**:\n   ```sh\n   make\n   ```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you still encounter issues, here are a few things to check:\n\n1. **Verify Paths**: Ensure that the paths in your `CMakeLists.txt` file are correct. Specifically, check that the `include_directories` and `target_link_libraries` paths are accurate.\n\n2. **Check File Locations**: Ensure that `raylib.h` is located in the `3rd/raylib/include` directory and that `libraylib.a` is in the `3rd/raylib/src` directory.\n\n3. **CMake Output**: Check the output of the `cmake ..` command for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with finding the Raylib headers or libraries.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully include Raylib in your project.\nyou are pretty dumb\nI'm sorry to hear that you're frustrated.
