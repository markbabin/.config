In C++, control flow statements like `if` statements must be inside a function or method - they can't exist directly in the class definition or at global scope.\n\nYou probably want to put this collision check inside a member function of the Bush class or in whatever function is handling your game's update logic. Here's how it could look:\n\n```cpp\nclass Bush {\npublic:\n    // ... other members ...\n    \n    void Update(Player& player) {\n        if (CheckCollisionRecs(player.GetCollisionBox(), bushBounds)) {\n            // Handle collision\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\nOr if this is in your game's main loop or update function:\n\n```cpp\nvoid GameUpdate() {\n    // ... other code ...\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(player.GetCollisionBox(), bush.GetBounds())) {\n        // Handle collision\n    }\n    // ... other code ...\n}\n```\n\nRemember that executable statements (like if statements) need to be inside functions - they can't be standalone in the code.\n#include <raylib.h>\n#include <bush.h>\n\nstatic const int NUM_FRAMES = 3;\nstatic const float FRAME_SPEED = 0.2f; // Seconds per frame\n\nBush::Bush(const char* texturePath)\n{\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    frameHeight = (float)texture.height/NUM_FRAMES;\n    frameWidth = (float)texture.width;\n    sourceRec = {0, 0, (float)texture.width, frameHeight};\n    bushBounds = {position.x, position.y, (float)texture.width, frameHeight};\n}\n\nRectangle Bush::GetBounds(){\n    return bushBounds;\n}\nvoid Bush::Update(){\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(player.GetCollisionBox(), bushBounds) && !player.isPlayerMoving()){\n        frameTimer += GetFrameTime();\n        if (frameTimer >= FRAME_SPEED) {\n            frameTimer = 0.0f;\n            currentFrame++;\n            if (currentFrame >= NUM_FRAMES) currentFrame = 0;\n\n            // Update the source rectangle for animation\n            sourceRec.y = currentFrame * frameHeight;\n    }\n}\n}\nvoid Bush::Draw(){\n    DrawTextureRec(texture, sourceRec, position, WHITE);\n}\nBush::~Bush() {\n    UnloadTexture(texture);\n}\ndo you see any issues or if i missed anything \nThere are a few potential issues and missing elements in your code:\n\n1. The `player` object in the Update function isn't defined - you need to either pass it as a parameter or have it as a member variable\nyou have to take into account that this file also has its header where everithung is declared, I dont think I need to initialize the player object in the bush.cpp file since it has an empty constructor and its already declared in header\nAh, if you have a Bush.h header file where the player object and other member variables are already declared, then the structure looks correct. Just make sure your header file includes:\n\n1. Declaration of member variables:\n```cpp\nprivate:\n    Texture2D texture;\n    Rectangle sourceRec;\n    Rectangle bushBounds;\n    Vector2 position;\n    float frameHeight;\n    float frameWidth;\n    float frameTimer = 0.0f;\n    int currentFrame = 0;\n    Player& player;  // Reference to player\n```\n\n2. Declaration of methods:\n```cpp\npublic:\n    Bush(const char* texturePath);\n    Rectangle GetBounds();\n    void Update();\n    void Draw();\n    ~Bush();\n```\n\nIf all these are properly declared in your header file, then your implementation looks good. The only suggestion might be to update `bushBounds` position in the Update method if the bush can move, but if it's stationary then the current implementation is fine.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":293}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":561,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":294}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":1596,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":295}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":87},"start":2701,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":296}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":88},"start":2906,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":297}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":255},"start":3143,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":298}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":256},"start":4046,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":299}}}],"summary":"If Statement Outside Function Scope","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
