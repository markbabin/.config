You'll need to first declare the second button as a member variable in your Game class header file, and then initialize it in the constructor like this:\n\n```cpp\nGame::Game() : \n    myButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69.png\", 70, 680, screen_height),\n    myButton2(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69.png\", 170, 680, screen_height)  // New button\n{\n}\n```\n\nMake sure you've declared both buttons in your Game class header file (Game.h):\n```cpp\nclass Game {\nprivate:\n    Button myButton;\n    Button myButton2;  // Add this declaration\n    // ... other members\n};\n```\n\nThe numbers 170, 680 in the second button represent different x, y coordinates to position the second button in a different location. You can adjust these values to place the button where you want it on the screen.\nwhy does highlight the opening ccurly bracket here \nGame::Game() :\n    myButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69.png\", 70, 680, screen_height),\n    myButtonRight(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69right.png\", 140, 740, screen_height),\n    myButtonDown(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69left.png\", 10, 740, screen_height),\n    {\n}\nThe error occurs because there's an extra comma after the last initialization in the member initialization list. Remove the comma after `screen_height)` and it should work correctly:\n\n```cpp\nGame::Game() :\n    myButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69.png\", 70, 680, screen_height),\n    myButtonRight(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69right.png\", 140, 740, screen_height),\n    myButtonDown(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/C++/sprite69left.png\", 10, 740, screen_height)  // Remove comma here\n{\n}\n```\n\nThe member initialization list should have commas between initializations but not after the last one before the opening curly brace.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":98}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":150,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":99}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":1066,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":100}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":80},"start":1400,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":101}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":81},"start":2028,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":102}}}],"summary":"Multiple Button Instance Constructor Initialization","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
