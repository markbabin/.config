Using `git pull`:\n```bash\ngit pull origin main  # or whatever branch you're working with\n```\nThis combines `git fetch` and `git merge` into one command.\n\n2. Using `git fetch` followed by `git merge`:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit merge origin/main\n```\n\n3. If you want to discard local changes and get the latest version:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit reset --hard origin/main\n```\n\nBefore pulling updates, it's good practice to:\n1. Save your current work\n2. Commit any local changes\n3. Check which branch you're on using `git status`\n\nRemember to replace `main` with your target branch name if it's different.\nif i just want to get what has been updated in the sprites folder in the repo how would i do that\nTo get updates for just the sprites folder, you can use either of these approaches:\n\n1. Using `git fetch` and `git checkout` for just that folder:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout origin/main -- sprites/\n```\n\n2. Or using `git sparse-checkout` if you only want to track that specific folder:\n```bash\ngit sparse-checkout set sprites/\ngit pull origin main\n```\n\nIf you want to see what's changed in the sprites folder before pulling:\n```bash\ngit fetch\ngit diff origin/main -- sprites/\n```\n\nThe first approach (using `git checkout`) is simpler if you just want to update that one folder once, while sparse-checkout is better if you want to permanently track only specific folders.\n\nRemember to replace `main` with your target branch name if different.\n#include \"dice_board.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"battle_phase.h\"\nBattlePhase::BattlePhase() : diceboard(){}\n\n\n\nvoid BattlePhase::Run(){\n    DrawTextureRec(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/background.png\", {0, 0, 960, 540}, {0, 0}, WHITE);\n    diceboard.Run();\n\n}\nwhy isnt it letting me use this raylib function here \nThe DrawTextureRec function in Raylib requires a Texture2D object, not a string path to an image. You need to load the texture first using LoadTexture(). Here's how to fix it:\n\n```cpp\nclass BattlePhase {\nprivate:\n    Texture2D background;\n    DiceBoard diceboard;\n\npublic:\n    BattlePhase() : diceboard() {\n        // Load the texture in the constructor\n        background = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/background.png\");\n    }\n\n    ~BattlePhase() {\n        // Don't forget to unload the texture when you're done\n        UnloadTexture(background);\n    }\n\n    void Run() {\n        // Now use the loaded texture\n        DrawTextureRec(background, Rectangle{0, 0, 960, 540}, Vector2{0, 0}, WHITE);\n        diceboard.Run();\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThe DrawTextureRec function expects these parameters:\n- Texture2D texture: The actual texture object, not a path\n- Rectangle source: The part of the texture to draw\n- Vector2 position: Where to draw it\n- Color tint: The color to tint the texture with\n\nMake sure to:\n1. Load the texture once (usually in constructor)\n2. Store it as a member variable\n3. Unload it when you're done (in destructor)\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":228}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":69,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":229}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":23},"start":769,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":230}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":74},"start":867,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":231}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":75},"start":1619,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":232}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":197},"start":1966,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":233}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":198},"start":3136,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":234}}}],"summary":"Git Pull Local Folder Updates","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
