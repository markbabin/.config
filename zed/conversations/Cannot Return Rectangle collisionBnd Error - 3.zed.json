There are a few problems:\n\n1. You're missing the class scope resolution operator (`Tree::`)\n2. Missing a semicolon after `return collisionBnd`\n3. The function might not be declared in your header file\n\nHere's the corrected version:\n\n```cpp\nRectangle Tree::GetCollisionBox() {\n    return collisionBnd;\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure that the function is properly declared in your `trees.h` file. The header file should include something like:\n\n```cpp\nclass Tree {\nprivate:\n    // ... other member variables\n    Rectangle collisionBnd;\n\npublic:\n    // ... other member functions\n    Rectangle GetCollisionBox();  // Function declaration\n};\n```\n\nThe error occurs because the compiler doesn't recognize the function as being part of the `Tree` class without the `Tree::` scope resolution operator, and every C++ statement needs to end with a semicolon. Make sure both the declaration in the header file and the definition in the source file are correct.\nhow would i add my build folder to gitignore\nTo add your build folder to .gitignore, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create or open the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory\n2. Add the following line:\n\n```\nbuild/\n```\n\nOr if you want to be more specific:\n```\n/build/\nbuild/*\n```\n\nYou can also ignore specific file types within the build folder:\n```\nbuild/*.o\nbuild/*.exe\n```\n\nIf you've already committed the build folder to git, you'll need to remove it from git's tracking (but keep it locally) with these commands:\n```bash\ngit rm -r --cached build\ngit commit -m \"Remove build folder from git tracking\"\n```\n\nThen the .gitignore will prevent it from being tracked in future commits.\nhow would i revert from git add . since i added the folders i later specified in gitignore\nTo undo a `git add .` before committing, you can use:\n\n```bash\ngit reset\n```\n\nIf you want to remove specific folders/files that were staged, you can use:\n```bash\ngit reset build/\n```\n\nIf you've already committed the files but want to remove them from git tracking while keeping them on your filesystem, use:\n```bash\ngit rm -r --cached build/\ngit commit -m \"Remove build directory from git tracking\"\n```\n\nAfter doing this, make sure your .gitignore is properly set up to prevent these files from being tracked again in future commits.\n\nRemember, `git reset` will unstage all changes while keeping your working directory unchanged. If you want to see what's currently staged, you can use `git status` before and after running these commands.\nwhy is git following the changes in folders i added in gitignore M\t.DS_Store\nM\t.cache/clangd/index/game_menu.cpp.528EA77DC42E997D.idx\nM\t.cache/clangd/index/game_menu.h.9813204C7F8DADEC.idx\nM\t.cache/clangd/index/globals.h.35AB085B8BD1821B.idx\nM\t.cache/clangd/index/player.h.1CB81DC7DD343AC0.idx\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/3.31.2/CMakeDetermineCompilerABI_C.bin\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/3.31.2/CMakeDetermineCompilerABI_CXX.bin\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/CMakeConfigureLog.yaml\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/Makefile2\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/DependInfo.cmake\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/build.make\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/cmake_clean.cmake\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/compiler_depend.internal\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/compiler_depend.make\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/link.txt\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/progress.make\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/src/game_menu.cpp.o.d\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/src/main.cpp.o\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/src/main.cpp.o.d\nM\tbuild/CMakeFiles/progress.marks\nM\tbuild/Makefile\nM\tbuild/compile_commands.json\nM\tbuild/polyamn\nM\tinc/game_menu.h\nM\tinc/globals.h\nM\tinc/level_one.h\nM\tinc/player.h\nM\tsrc/game_menu.cpp\nM\tsrc/level_one.cpp\nIf Git is still tracking these files, it's likely because they were already being tracked before you added them to .gitignore. The .gitignore file only prevents untracked files from being added to Git; it doesn't remove files that are already being tracked.\n\nTo fix this, you need to:\n\n1. First, remove these files from Git's tracking while keeping them on your filesystem:\n```bash\ngit rm -r --cached .DS_Store\ngit rm -r --cached .cache/\ngit rm -r --cached build/\n```\n\n2. Make sure your .gitignore contains:\n```\n.DS_Store\n.cache/\nbuild/\n```\n\n3. Then commit these changes:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Remove ignored files from Git tracking\"\n```\n\nAfter this, Git should stop tracking these files, and any future changes to them will be ignored as specified in your .gitignore file.\n\nIf you want to verify what Git is tracking after these changes, you can use:\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\nThis should show you only the files that aren't specified in your .gitignore file.\ni updated my gitignore and removed some files from git tracking but now i cant push to github gettting this error what should i do  polyamn % git push origin main\nTo https://github.com/markbabin/polyamn.git\n!

This is usually caused by another repository pushing\nhint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes\nhint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\nThis error occurs when your local repository is behind the remote repository (GitHub). You need to synchronize your local repository with the remote one before pushing. Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. First, try pulling the changes from the remote:\n```bash\ngit pull origin main\n```\n\nIf there are no conflicts, you can then push:\n```bash\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nIf you get a merge conflict message, you have two options:\n\nOption 1 - If you're sure your local changes are the ones you want to keep:\n```bash\ngit pull --rebase origin main\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nOption 2 - If you want to force push your changes (USE WITH CAUTION - this will overwrite remote changes):\n```bash\ngit push -f origin main\n```\n\nWARNING: Force pushing (`-f`) should be used carefully as it overwrites the remote history and can cause problems if others are working on the same repository.\n\nThe safest approach is usually:\n1. `git pull origin main`\n2. Resolve any conflicts if they exist\n3. `git push origin main`\n\nIf you're working alone on the repository and you're sure you want your local version to be the source of truth, you can use the force push option.\ncan you spot why only the first tree1 object works correctly its weird because the other tree objects are created the same way\nCould you share the relevant code showing how you're creating and handling the multiple tree objects? The issue could be related to:\n\n1. Memory management/scope issues\n2. Position settings\n3. How you're storing or accessing the tree objects\n4. Array indexing if you're using an array of trees\n5. Constructor initialization differences\n\nIf you could show:\n1. How you're declaring the tree objects\n2. How you're initializing them\n3. How you're drawing/updating them\n4. The relevant game loop code\n\nThat would help identify why only the first tree is working correctly while the others aren't behaving as expected.\n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne() :\n    player(),\n    tree1(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree2(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {758, 50}),\n    tree3(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {848, 140}),\n    tree4(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {472, 324}){}\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n  BeginDrawing();\n\n  // Update\n  player.Update();\n\n  // Collision\n  if (tree1.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree1.GetCollisionBox())) {\n       // collision handling code\n       std::cout << \"tree collision works\" << std::endl;\n\n   }\n\n\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  // Draw\n  player.Draw();\n  tree1.Draw();\n  tree2.Draw();\n  tree3.Draw();\n  tree4.Draw();\n\n\n  EndDrawing();\n}\n\nThe issue likely comes from how the position is being handled in your Tree class. You're setting the initial position in the constructor using the Vector2 parameter, but you're not using it correctly for all parts of the tree.\n\nLooking at your Tree constructor:\n\n```cpp\nTree::Tree(const char *texturePath, Vector2 pos) : player()\n{\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    float x = pos.x;\n    float y = pos.y;\n\n    // You set up collisionBnd with x and y\n    collisionBnd = {x, y + 150, (float)texture.width, frameHeight - 150};\n    \n    // But you might not be setting 'position' which is used in Draw()\n}\n```\n\nThe issue might be that you're setting up `collisionBnd` with the position, but not setting the `position` member variable that's used in the `Draw()` function. You need to set both:\n\n```cpp\nTree::Tree(const char *texturePath, Vector2 pos) : player()\n{\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    position = pos;  // Add this line!\n    \n    float x = pos.x;\n    float y = pos.y;\n\n    frameHeight = (float)texture.height;\n    frameWidth = (float)texture.width;\n\n    sourceRec = {0, 0, (float)texture.width, (float)texture.height};\n    collisionBnd = {x, y + 150, (float)texture.width, frameHeight - 150};\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure you're checking collisions for all trees, not just tree1:\n\n```cpp\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n\n    player.Update();\n\n    // Check collisions for all trees\n    if (tree1.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree1.GetCollisionBox()) ||\n        tree2.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree2.GetCollisionBox()) ||\n        tree3.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree3.GetCollisionBox()) ||\n        tree4.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree4.GetCollisionBox())) {\n        std::cout << \"tree collision works\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    \n    player.Draw();\n    tree1.Draw();\n    tree2.Draw();\n    tree3.Draw();\n    tree4.Draw();\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nThis should make all trees work consistently with both drawing and collisions.\n    void Update() {\n        if (!isComplete) {\n            timer += GetFrameTime();\n            // if enough time passed add next character\n            if (timer >= charDelay && currentChar < messages[currentMessageIndex].length()) {\n                currentText += messages[currentMessageIndex][currentChar];\n                currentChar++;\n                timer = 0;\n            }\n            // check if we displayed all chars\n            if (currentChar >= messages[currentMessageIndex].length() && IsKeyDown(KEY_SPACE)) {\n                isComplete = true;\n                currentMessageIndex++;\n                if (currentMessageIndex < messages.size()) {\n                    Reset(messages[currentMessageIndex]);\n                }\n                else {\n                    isDialogComplete = true; // we need this for yes/no buttons in cutscenes\n                    std::cout << \"show the I will help/I wont help buttons\" << std::endl;\n                    currentDialogState = END;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\nhow would i add logic if space is pressed skip the character by characted display and show the full string \nHere's how you can modify the Update function to allow skipping the character-by-character display when SPACE is pressed:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Update() {\n    if (!isComplete) {\n        timer += GetFrameTime();\n        \n        // If SPACE is pressed, show the entire current message immediately\n        if (IsKeyPressed(KEY_SPACE)) {\n            currentText = messages[currentMessageIndex];\n            currentChar = messages[currentMessageIndex].length();\n            timer = 0;\n        }\n        // Normal character-by-character display\n        else if (timer >= charDelay && currentChar < messages[currentMessageIndex].length()) {\n            currentText += messages[currentMessageIndex][currentChar];\n            currentChar++;\n            timer = 0;\n        }\n\n        // Move to next message if current one is complete and SPACE is pressed\n        if (currentChar >= messages[currentMessageIndex].length() && IsKeyPressed(KEY_SPACE)) {\n            isComplete = true;\n            currentMessageIndex++;\n            if (currentMessageIndex < messages.size()) {\n                Reset(messages[currentMessageIndex]);\n            }\n            else {\n                isDialogComplete = true;\n                std::cout << \"show the I will help/I wont help buttons\" << std::endl;\n                currentDialogState = END;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Added a check for `IsKeyPressed(KEY_SPACE)` at the start\n2. If SPACE is pressed, immediately set `currentText` to the full message\n3. Set `currentChar` to the length of the message to indicate it's complete\n4. Changed `IsKeyDown` to `IsKeyPressed` to prevent multiple triggers\n5. Used `else if` for the normal character-by-character display\n\nThis way:\n- If SPACE is not pressed, text appears character by character\n- If SPACE is pressed once, the current message appears instantly\n- If SPACE is pressed again, it moves to the next message\n- The final SPACE press will still trigger the end state\nthis only resets the display to the next string i want it to fully display the current string if space is pressed\nAh, I understand now. Here's the modified Update function to show the full current string when SPACE is pressed:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Update() {\n    if (!isComplete) {\n        timer += GetFrameTime();\n        \n        // If SPACE is held, display the full current message immediately\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_SPACE)) {\n            currentText = messages[currentMessageIndex];\n            currentChar = messages[currentMessageIndex].length();\n        }\n        // Normal character-by-character display\n        else if (timer >= charDelay && currentChar < messages[currentMessageIndex].length()) {\n            currentText += messages[currentMessageIndex][currentChar];\n            currentChar++;\n            timer = 0;\n        }\n\n        // Move to next message if current one is complete and SPACE is pressed again\n        if (currentChar >= messages[currentMessageIndex].length() && IsKeyPressed(KEY_SPACE)) {\n            isComplete = true;\n            currentMessageIndex++;\n            if (currentMessageIndex < messages.size()) {\n                Reset(messages[currentMessageIndex]);\n            }\n            else {\n                isDialogComplete = true;\n                std::cout << \"show the I will help/I wont help buttons\" << std::endl;\n                currentDialogState = END;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe main changes:\n1. Removed the immediate message switching when SPACE is first pressed\n2. While SPACE is held, it will show the full current message\n3. Only advances to the next message when SPACE is pressed after the current message is fully displayed\n\nNow:\n- Normal typing happens character by character\n- Holding SPACE shows the full current message\n- Pressing SPACE after the message is complete moves to the next message\nRectangle Tree::GetCollisionBox(){\n    return collisionBnd;\n}\nhow would i print this out with cout \nTo print out a Rectangle struct with cout, you'll need to access its individual members (x, y, width, height). Here's how you can do it:\n\n```cpp\nRectangle Tree::GetCollisionBox(){\n    // Print the rectangle's properties\n    std::cout << \"Rectangle: x=\" << collisionBnd.x \n              << \", y=\" << collisionBnd.y \n              << \", width=\" << collisionBnd.width \n              << \", height=\" << collisionBnd.height \n              << std::endl;\n    \n    return collisionBnd;\n}\n```\n\nOr if you want to make a separate function just for debugging:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Tree::PrintCollisionBox(){\n    std::cout << \"Rectangle: x=\" << collisionBnd.x \n              << \", y=\" << collisionBnd.y \n              << \", width=\" << collisionBnd.width \n              << \", height=\" << collisionBnd.height \n              << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to include the iostream header:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n```\n\nYou can then call it like:\n```cpp\ntree1.PrintCollisionBox();\n// or\nRectangle rect = tree1.GetCollisionBox();\nstd::cout << \"Rectangle: x=\" << rect.x \n          << \", y=\" << rect.y \n          << \", width=\" << rect.width \n          << \", height=\" << rect.height \n          << std::endl;\n```\nwhen i set the position here with setPos:\n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne() :\n    player(),\n    tree1(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree2(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree3(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree4(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0})\n\n\n    {}\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n  BeginDrawing();\n\n  // Update\n  player.Update();\n\n  // Collision\n  if (tree1.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree1.GetCollisionBox())) {\n       std::cout << \"tree collision works\" << std::endl;\n   }\n  if (tree2.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree2.GetCollisionBox())) {\n       std::cout << \"tree2 collision works\" << std::endl;\n   }\n  if (tree3.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree3.GetCollisionBox())) {\n       std::cout << \"tree3 collision works\" << std::endl;\n   }\n  if (tree4.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree4.GetCollisionBox())) {\n       std::cout << \"tree4 collision works\" << std::endl;\n   }\n\n\n\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  // Draw\n  player.Draw();\n  tree1.Draw();\n  tree2.Draw();\n  tree3.Draw();\n\n  tree2.SetPos({156, 276});\n  tree3.SetPos({758, 50});\n  tree4.SetPos({848, 140});\n\n  EndDrawing();\n}\ndo the x and y values in here update trees.cpp:\n#include \"trees.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\n// Constructor\nTree::Tree(const char *texturePath, Vector2 pos) : player()\n{\n\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    float x = pos.x;\n    float y = pos.y;\n\n    // Frame dimensions\n    frameHeight = (float)texture.height;\n    frameWidth = (float)texture.width;\n\n    // Source rec to select how much texture to draw\n    sourceRec = {0, 0, (float)texture.width, (float)texture.height};\n    collisionBnd = {x, y + 150, (float)texture.width, frameHeight - 150};\n}\n\n// Draw\nvoid Tree::Draw(){\n    DrawTextureRec(texture, sourceRec, position, WHITE);\n}\n// Collisions\nbool Tree::CheckTreeCollision(Rectangle rec1, Rectangle rec2){\n    return CheckCollisionRecs(rec1, rec2);\n}\n\n\n\n// Set pos\nvoid Tree::SetPos(Vector2 pos){\n    position = pos;\n}\n// Get\n Vector2 Tree::GetPos(){\n    return position;\n}\nRectangle Tree::GetCollisionBox(){\n    return collisionBnd;\n}\n\nNo, in your current implementation, `SetPos` only updates the `position` used for drawing but doesn't update the `collisionBnd`. You need to update the collision boundary when setting a new position. Here's how to fix it:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Tree::SetPos(Vector2 pos){\n    position = pos;\n    // Update collision boundary with new position\n    collisionBnd.x = pos.x;\n    collisionBnd.y = pos.y + 150;  // Keep the same offset you used in constructor\n}\n```\n\nAlso, you should move the `SetPos` calls before the collision checks in your `LevelOne::Run()`:\n\n```cpp\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n\n    // Update\n    player.Update();\n\n    // Set positions first\n    tree2.SetPos({156, 276});\n    tree3.SetPos({758, 50});\n    tree4.SetPos({848, 140});\n\n    // Then check collisions\n    if (tree1.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree1.GetCollisionBox())) {\n        std::cout << \"tree collision works\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    if (tree2.CheckTreeCollision(player.getRectangle(), tree2.GetCollisionBox())) {\n        std::cout << \"tree2 collision works\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    // ... rest of collision checks ...\n\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    // Draw\n    player.Draw();\n    tree1.Draw();\n    tree2.Draw();\n    tree3.Draw();\n    tree4.Draw();  // Don't forget to draw tree4\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you might want to initialize the `position` in your constructor:\n\n```cpp\nTree::Tree(const char *texturePath, Vector2 pos) : player()\n{\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    position = pos;  // Initialize position\n    \n    // Frame dimensions\n    frameHeight = (float)texture.height;\n    frameWidth = (float)texture.width;\n\n    // Source rec to select how much texture to draw\n    sourceRec = {0, 0, (float)texture.width, (float)texture.height};\n    collisionBnd = {pos.x, pos.y + 150, (float)texture.width, frameHeight - 150};\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure both the drawing position and collision boundary are properly initialized and updated when positions change.\ndo we really need to set colbnd.y to pos.y + 150 wouldnt that duble the add of 150\n\nYou're right! In your constructor, you're already setting up the collision boundary with `y + 150`, so if you add another 150 in `SetPos`, you'd be doubling the offset. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Tree::SetPos(Vector2 pos){\n    position = pos;\n    // Update collision boundary with new position\n    collisionBnd.x = pos.x;\n    collisionBnd.y = pos.y;  // Remove the +150 since it's already factored in from constructor\n}\n```\n\nFor clarity, let's see the flow:\n1. In constructor: `collisionBnd = {x, y + 150, ...}` - sets initial offset\n2. In SetPos: `collisionBnd.y = pos.y` - maintains that offset by just updating the base position\n\nNow when you call `SetPos`, it will correctly update both the drawing position and the collision boundary without doubling the offset.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4616}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":939,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4617}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":1944,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4618}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":91},"start":1989,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4619}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":92},"start":2639,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4620}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":174},"start":2730,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4621}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":175},"start":3470,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4622}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":254},"start":4636,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4623}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":255},"start":5596,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4624}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":491},"start":6278,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4625}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":492},"start":7412,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4626}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1473},"start":7539,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4627}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1474},"start":8151,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4628}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1527},"start":9020,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4629}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1528},"start":11066,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4630}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1966},"start":12210,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4631}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1967},"start":14177,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4632}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2292},"start":14291,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4633}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2293},"start":16038,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4634}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2447},"start":16138,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4635}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":2448},"start":17320,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4636}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3164},"start":19641,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4637}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3165},"start":21631,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4638}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3788},"start":21715,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4639}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":3789},"start":22499,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4640}}}],"summary":"Cannot Return Rectangle collisionBnd Error","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
