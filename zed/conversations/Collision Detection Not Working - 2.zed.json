Specifically, the function is designed to resolve the collision by moving `rect1` (the player) out of the collision area, but it doesn't actually stop the player from moving into the collision area in the first place. This means that the player can still move into the tree, and the collision resolution will just push the player out, which might not be noticeable.\n\nTo make the player stop when colliding with the tree, you need to adjust the player's position and/or velocity based on the collision detection. Here is a modified version of the `recHitboxCollision` function that stops the player when a collision is detected:\n\n```cpp\nvoid recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2, Vector2 &playerVelocity) {\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX; // Push player back to the left\n        playerVelocity.x = 0; // Stop player movement in the x direction\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n        playerVelocity.x = 0; // Stop player movement in the x direction\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n        playerVelocity.y = 0; // Stop player movement in the y direction\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n        playerVelocity.y = 0; // Stop player movement in the y direction\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, the function takes an additional parameter `playerVelocity`, which is a reference to the player's velocity vector. When a collision is detected, the function not only adjusts the player's position but also sets the player's velocity to zero in the direction of the collision. This effectively stops the player from moving into the tree.\n\nYou will also need to modify the `Run` function in `LevelOne` to pass the player's velocity to the `recHitboxCollision` function. Assuming the `player` object has a method to get its velocity, the code might look something like this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n  BeginDrawing();\n\n  // Update\n  player.Update();\n\n  // Collision\n  Rectangle playerBox = player.GetCollisionBox();\n  Rectangle tree1Box = tree1.GetCollisionBox();\n  Vector2 playerVelocity = player.GetVelocity();\n\n  RectUtils::recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box, playerVelocity);\n\n  // Update the player's velocity after collision resolution\n  player.SetVelocity(playerVelocity);\n\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n  // We need to prioritize drawing based on objects y axis\n  std::vector<std::pair<float, std::function<void()>>> drawables = {\n      {player.anchorPoint, [&]() { player.Draw(); }},\n              {tree1.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree1.Draw(); }},\n              {tree2.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree2.Draw(); }},\n              {tree3.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree3.Draw(); }},\n              {tree4.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree4.Draw(); }}\n  };\n  // Sort the vector by the y position (ascending)\n  std::sort(drawables.begin(), drawables.end(),\n      [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {return a.first < b.first;});\n  // Draw in sorted order\n  for (const auto& drawable : drawables){\n      drawable.second();\n  }\n\n  tree2.SetPos({156, 276});\n  tree3.SetPos({758, 50});\n  tree4.SetPos({848, 140});\n\n  EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nMake sure that the `player` class has methods `GetVelocity` and `SetVelocity` to get and set the player's velocity, respectively. This way, the player's movement will be properly stopped when a collision is detected.\nthere is an issue i created this function with taking two rectangle parameters since i wanted to put in hitbox rectangle data of objects but now im not sure how would i adjust the speed when the if resolves in our rec util functtion\nGiven that the `recHitboxCollision` function is designed to work with two `Rectangle` parameters, and you want to adjust the player's speed based on the collision, you need to find a way to pass the player's velocity to the function without changing its signature too much. One approach is to use a global or static variable to store the player's velocity, but a cleaner approach would be to encapsulate the collision logic within the player class itself.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `recHitboxCollision` function to work with the player's velocity while keeping the function signature the same:\n\n1. **Modify the `recHitboxCollision` function to return a collision result:**\n\n```cpp\nstruct CollisionResult {\n    bool collided;\n    float overlapX;\n    float overlapY;\n};\n\nCollisionResult recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle &rect1, const Rectangle &rect2) {\n    CollisionResult result = {false, 0.0f, 0.0f};\n\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        result.collided = true;\n        result.overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                          std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n        result.overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                          std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Update the `Run` function to handle the collision result and adjust the player's velocity:**\n\n```cpp\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n\n    // Update\n    player.Update();\n\n    // Collision\n    Rectangle playerBox = player.GetCollisionBox();\n    Rectangle tree1Box = tree1.GetCollisionBox();\n    Vector2 playerVelocity = player.GetVelocity();\n\n    CollisionResult collision = RectUtils::recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box);\n\n    if (collision.collided) {\n        // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n        if (collision.overlapX < collision.overlapY) {\n            if (playerBox.x < tree1Box.x) {\n                playerBox.x -= collision.overlapX; // Push player back to the left\n                playerVelocity.x = 0; // Stop player movement in the x direction\n            } else {\n                playerBox.x += collision.overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n                playerVelocity.x = 0; // Stop player movement in the x direction\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (playerBox.y < tree1Box.y) {\n                playerBox.y -= collision.overlapY; // Push player back up\n                playerVelocity.y = 0; // Stop player movement in the y direction\n            } else {\n                playerBox.y += collision.overlapY; // Push player back down\n                playerVelocity.y = 0; // Stop player movement in the y direction\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Update the player's velocity and position after collision resolution\n    player.SetVelocity(playerVelocity);\n    player.SetPosition({playerBox.x, playerBox.y});\n\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n    // We need to prioritize drawing based on objects y axis\n    std::vector<std::pair<float, std::function<void()>>> drawables = {\n        {player.anchorPoint, [&]() { player.Draw(); }},\n        {tree1.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree1.Draw(); }},\n        {tree2.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree2.Draw(); }},\n        {tree3.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree3.Draw(); }},\n        {tree4.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree4.Draw(); }}\n    };\n    // Sort the vector by the y position (ascending)\n    std::sort(drawables.begin(), drawables.end(),\n        [](const auto& a, const auto& b) { return a.first < b.first; });\n    // Draw in sorted order\n    for (const auto& drawable : drawables) {\n        drawable.second();\n    }\n\n    tree2.SetPos({156, 276});\n    tree3.SetPos({758, 50});\n    tree4.SetPos({848, 140});\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\n3. **Ensure the `player` class has methods to get and set its position and velocity:**\n\n```cpp\nclass Player {\npublic:\n    // Other methods...\n\n    Vector2 GetVelocity() const {\n        return velocity;\n    }\n\n    void SetVelocity(const Vector2& newVelocity) {\n        velocity = newVelocity;\n    }\n\n    Rectangle GetCollisionBox() const {\n        // Return the player's collision box\n    }\n\n    void SetPosition(const Vector2& newPosition) {\n        position = newPosition;\n    }\n\n    void Update() {\n        // Update the player's position based on its velocity\n        position.x += velocity.x;\n        position.y += velocity.y;\n    }\n\n    void Draw() const {\n        // Draw the player\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    Vector2 position;\n    Vector2 velocity;\n    // Other member variables...\n};\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the player's velocity is properly adjusted when a collision is detected, and the player will stop moving into the tree. This approach keeps the collision detection logic separate from the player class while still allowing the player's velocity to be adjusted based on collisions.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":205}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":68},"start":2816,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":206}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":69},"start":6793,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":207}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":172},"start":7026,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":208}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":173},"start":11886,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":209}}}],"summary":"Collision Detection Not Working","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
