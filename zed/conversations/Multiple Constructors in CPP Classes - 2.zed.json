This is called constructor overloading. Here's an example:\n\n```cpp\nclass Rectangle {\nprivate:\n    int length;\n    int width;\n\npublic:\n    // Default constructor\n    Rectangle() {\n        length = 0;\n        width = 0;\n    }\n\n    // Parameterized constructor with one parameter\n    Rectangle(int size) {\n        length = size;\n        width = size;\n    }\n\n    // Parameterized constructor with two parameters\n    Rectangle(int l, int w) {\n        length = l;\n        width = w;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Rectangle r1;          // Calls default constructor\n    Rectangle r2(5);       // Calls constructor with one parameter\n    Rectangle r3(4, 6);    // Calls constructor with two parameters\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nKey points about multiple constructors:\n\n1. They must have different parameter lists (different number or types of parameters)\n2. This allows objects to be created in different ways\n3. The compiler determines which constructor to call based on the arguments provided\n4. All constructors must have the same name as the class\n5. A class can have as many constructors as needed\n\nThis feature is useful when you want to provide different ways to initialize an object of your class.\nand if i have one with parameters and one without will the program know which one im using based on parameters\nYes, exactly! The program will automatically choose the appropriate constructor based on whether or not you provide parameters when creating an object. This is called constructor overload resolution. Here's an example:\n\n```cpp\nclass Student {\nprivate:\n    string name;\n    int age;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor with no parameters\n    Student() {\n        name = \"Unknown\";\n        age = 0;\n    }\n\n    // Constructor with parameters\n    Student(string n, int a) {\n        name = n;\n        age = a;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // This will call the constructor with no parameters\n    Student student1;\n\n    // This will call the constructor with parameters\n    Student student2(\"John\", 20);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler automatically:\n- Uses the no-parameter constructor when you create an object without parameters: `Student student1;`\n- Uses the parameterized constructor when you provide the matching parameters: `Student student2(\"John\", 20);`\n\nThis selection happens at compile time, and the compiler will give you an error if you try to call a constructor with the wrong number or types of parameters.\nis there a way in zed editor to res","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":141}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":44,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":142}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":1287,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":143}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":87},"start":1398,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":144}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":88},"start":2508,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":145}}}],"summary":"Multiple Constructors in CPP Classes","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
