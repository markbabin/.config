In C++, member variables aren't automatically initialized to null/zero values.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n1. Either initialize the texture in the initialization list:\n\n```cpp\nDice::Dice(const char* texturePath, Vector2 pos) : texture{0} {  // Initialize texture to zero\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    // rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\n2. Or add a default member initializer in the header file:\n\n```cpp\nclass Dice {\npublic:\n    // ... other members ...\nprivate:\n    Texture2D texture{0};  // Initialize texture to zero\n    // ... other members ...\n};\n```\n\nAlso, make sure that:\n1. The texture file path is valid and the file exists\n2. The texture file is in the correct directory relative to where your executable runs\n3. You're cleaning up the texture when you're done with it (you might want to add a destructor):\n\n```cpp\n~Dice() {\n    UnloadTexture(texture);\n}\n```\n\nIf you're still getting a segfault, try adding more debug output to pinpoint exactly where it's occurring. You could also check if the texture dimensions are valid after loading:\n\n```cpp\nDice::Dice(const char* texturePath, Vector2 pos) : texture{0} {\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    if (texture.id == 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to load texture: \" << texturePath << std::endl;\n        return;\n    }\n    std::cout << \"Texture dimensions: \" << texture.width << \"x\" << texture.height << std::endl;\n    // rest of the code...\n}\n```\nhow would i implement the destructor?\nTo implement the destructor for your Dice class, you need to:\n\n1. First declare it in your header file (dice.h):\n```cpp\nclass Dice {\npublic:\n    Dice(const char* texturePath, Vector2 pos);\n    ~Dice();  // Add this line\n    // ... rest of your public methods ...\n\nprivate:\n    // ... your private members ...\n};\n```\n\n2. Then implement it in your source file (dice.cpp):\n```cpp\nDice::~Dice() {\n    UnloadTexture(texture);  // This frees the texture from memory\n    std::cout << \"Dice destroyed, texture unloaded\" << std::endl;  // Optional debug message\n}\n```\n\nThe destructor will be called automatically when:\n- A Dice object goes out of scope\n- A Dice object created with 'new' is deleted\n- The program ends and any remaining Dice objects are cleaned up\n\nFor example, if you use the Dice class like this:\n```cpp\n{\n    Dice myDice(\"texture.png\", {100, 100});  // Constructor called\n    // Use the dice\n}  // Destructor called here when myDice goes out of scope\n```\n\nOr if you're using dynamic allocation:\n```cpp\nDice* myDice = new Dice(\"texture.png\", {100, 100});  // Constructor called\n// Use the dice\ndelete myDice;  // Destructor called here\n```\n\nThe destructor ensures that the texture memory is properly freed when you're done with the Dice object, preventing memory leaks.\nsetting up a destructor didnt do anything for the segfault also take a look at the compiler message when trying to run the exe maybe it will help you. to me it seems the texture isnt causing issues at least with loading up \nINFO: FILEIO: [/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/basic_dice.png] File loaded successfully\nINFO: IMAGE: Data loaded successfully (64x384 | R8G8B8A8 | 1 mipmaps)\nzsh: segmentation fault  ./Simoncello\nThe file seems to be loading correctly (as evidenced by the successful load message), and the image dimensions look right (64x384 for what appears to be a sprite sheet with 6 frames of 64x64 each).\n\nLooking at this again, I notice that when you set up diceBound and sourceRec in the constructor, you're using position values before properly initializing them. Let's try restructuring your constructor with an initialization list to ensure all members are properly initialized:\n\n```cpp\nDice::Dice(const char* texturePath, Vector2 pos) \n    : position(pos)\n    , diceThrowState(6)\n    , NUM_FRAMES(6)\n    , isMouseHeld(false)\n    , mousePoint{0.0f, 0.0f}\n    , texture{0}\n{\n    texture = LoadTexture(texturePath);\n    if (texture.id == 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to load texture: \" << texturePath << std::endl;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    frameHeight = (float)texture.height/NUM_FRAMES;\n    \n    // Now set up the rectangles after all other members are initialized\n    sourceRec = {0, 0, (float)texture.width, frameHeight};\n    diceBound = {position.x, position.y, (float)texture.width, frameHeight};\n}\n```\n\nAlso, could you share the code where you're creating and using the Dice object? The segfault might be happening due to how the object is being created or accessed.\n\nIf this doesn't help, try adding more debug prints throughout your code to see exactly where it's crashing:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Dice::Draw(){\n    std::cout << \"Starting Draw\" << std::endl;\n    DrawTextureRec(texture, sourceRec, position, WHITE);\n    std::cout << \"Texture drawn\" << std::endl;\n    DrawText(\"dice draw works\", 0, 0, 20, BLACK);\n    std::cout << \"Draw complete\" << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nThis will help pinpoint exactly where the segfault is occurring.\n#include \"dice_board.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"dice.h\"\n\n\nDiceBoard::DiceBoard() : dice1(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/basic_dice.png\", {0, 0})\n{}\n\nvoid DiceBoard::Run(){\n    BeginDrawing();\n    //Update\n    dice1.Update();\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    //Draw\n    DrawText(\"dice board works\", 0, 0, 15, BLACK);\n    dice1.Draw();\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\nthis is where im creating and using a dice object\nI see a potential issue here. In the `DiceBoard` class, you're creating the `Dice` object in the member initialization list, but there might be timing issues with Raylib's initialization.\n\nTry moving the Dice creation to after Raylib has been properly initialized. Here's how you could modify your code:\n\n```cpp\n// dice_board.h\nclass DiceBoard {\npublic:\n    DiceBoard();\n    void Run();\n    void Initialize();  // Add this method\nprivate:\n    Dice dice1;  // Just declare it\n};\n\n// dice_board.cpp\nDiceBoard::DiceBoard() {\n    // Don't create the dice here\n}\n\n     \n\nvoid DiceBoard::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n    //Update\n    dice1.Update();\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    //Draw\n    DrawText(\"dice board works\", 0, 0, 15, BLACK);\n    dice1.Draw();\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nThen in your main function, make sure to:\n1. Initialize Raylib first\n2. Initialize the DiceBoard\n3. Run your game loop\n\nLike this:\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(800, 600, \"Game\");\n    \n    DiceBoard board;\n    board.Initialize();  // Initialize after window creation\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        board.Run();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that Raylib is fully initialized before any texture loading occurs. The segmentation fault might be happening because you're trying to load textures before Raylib's systems are ready to handle them.\n\nLet me know if this helps resolve the segmentation fault!\n and where in your genious code did you even actually initialize the texture and everything moron?\nAh, you're absolutely right - I apologize for the oversight! Let me fix that. You need to actually initialize the Dice object. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```cpp\n// dice_board.h\nclass DiceBoard {\npublic:\n    DiceBoard();\n    void Run();\n    void Initialize();  // Method to initialize dice\nprivate:\n    Dice* dice1;  // Make it a pointer so we can initialize it after Raylib setup\n};\n\n// dice_board.cpp\nDiceBoard::DiceBoard() : dice1(nullptr) {\n    // Constructor\n}\n\nvoid DiceBoard::Initialize() {\n    // Create the dice object after Raylib is initialized\n    dice1 = new Dice(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/basic_dice.png\", {0, 0});\n}\n\nvoid DiceBoard::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n    //Update\n    dice1->Update();\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    //Draw\n    DrawText(\"dice board works\", 0, 0, 15, BLACK);\n    dice1->Draw();\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nAnd don't forget to add a destructor to clean up:\n```cpp\nDiceBoard::~DiceBoard() {\n    if (dice1) {\n        delete dice1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSorry for the confusion in my previous response.
