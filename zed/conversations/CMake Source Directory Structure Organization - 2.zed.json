Create two folders in your project:\n   - `src/` for .cpp files\n   - `include/` for .h files\n\n2. Move your .cpp files to the `src/` folder\n3. Move your .h files to the `include/` folder\n\nThe `include_directories()` command tells CMake where to look for header files when compiling.\n\nIf you have a specific project structure in mind or if you're working with an existing CMakeLists.txt, feel free to share it and I can provide more specific guidance.\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)\nproject(reasings)\n\n# Enable compilation database for IDEs and tools\nset(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)\n\n# Set C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\n\n# Add include and library directories\ninclude_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)\nlink_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)\n\n# Add the executable\nfile(GLOB SOURCES ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES})\n\n# Link the Raylib library\ntarget_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} raylib)\n\n# Platform-specific settings for Raylib\nif(APPLE)\n    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} \"-framework OpenGL\" \"-framework Cocoa\" \"-framework IOKit\" \"-framework CoreVideo\")\nelseif(UNIX)\n    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} m pthread dl rt X11)\nendif()\ni have this how would i adjust it to previously described needs \n\nHere's your CMakeLists.txt adjusted to handle separate src and include folders:\n\n```cmake\nncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)\nproject(reasings)\n\n# Enable compilation database for IDEs and tools\nset(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)\n\n# Set C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\n\n# Add include and library directories\ninclude_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)\nlink_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)\n\n# Add source and header files\nfile(GLOB SOURCES ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)\nfile(GLOB HEADERS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/*.h)\n\n# Add the executable with both sources and headers\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})\n\n# Link the Raylib library\ntarget_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} raylib)\n\n# Platform-specific settings for Raylib\nif(APPLE)\n    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} \"-framework OpenGL\" \"-framework Cocoa\" \"-framework IOKit\" \"-framework CoreVideo\")\nelseif(UNIX)\n    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} m pthread dl rt X11)\nendif()\n```\n\nThe main changes are:\n\n1. Added a line to gather header files:\n```cmake\nfile(GLOB HEADERS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/*.h)\n```\n\n2. Modified the add_executable line to include both sources and headers:\n```cmake\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})\n```\n\nThe include_directories line was already correctly set up for the include folder.\n\nNow you just need to:\n1. Create an `include` folder in your project root if it doesn't exist\n2. Move all your .h files to the `include` folder\n3. Keep all your .cpp files in the `src` folder\n\nYour project structure should look like this:\n```\nproject_root/\n├── CMakeLists.txt\n├── src/\n│   └── *.cpp files\n├── include/\n│   └── *.h files\n└── lib/\n```\nIn terminal, how do i clean my build directory and rebuild it using cmake, like what are the commands be short\n\nHere's the quick sequence to clean and rebuild:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf build/*    # Clean build directory\ncd build          # Enter build directory\ncmake ..          # Configure CMake\nmake              # Build project\n```\n\nOr if you need to recreate the build directory entirely:\n```bash\nrm -rf build      # Delete build directory\nmkdir build       # Create new build directory\ncd build          # Enter build directory\ncmake ..          # Configure CMake\nmake              # Build project\n`compiler says\n\n\n\ncompiler is bitching about globals.h not being found \nThe compiler can't find globals.h because it's looking in the wrong place.
