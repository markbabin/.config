Here's one of the common approaches using reference passing:\n\n1. Modify your LevelOne class to accept a Player reference in its constructor:\n\n```cpp\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player& player;\n\npublic:\n    LevelOne(Player& playerRef) : player(playerRef) {} // Constructor takes a Player reference\n    void Run();\n};\n```\n\n2. Then in your GameMenu class, pass the player to LevelOne:\n\n```cpp\nclass GameMenu {\nprivate:\n    Player player;\n    LevelOne levelOneInstance;\n    LevelEnterance levelOne;\n    LevelEnterance levelTwo;\n    LevelEnterance levelThree;\n    LevelEnterance levelFour;\n\npublic:\n    GameMenu() : levelOneInstance(player) {} // Initialize LevelOne with player reference\n    void Run();\n};\n```\n\nAlternative approach using a pointer:\n\n```cpp\n// LevelOne.h\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player* player;\n\npublic:\n    LevelOne(Player* playerPtr) : player(playerPtr) {}\n    void Run();\n};\n\n// GameMenu.h\nclass GameMenu {\nprivate:\n    Player player;\n    LevelOne levelOneInstance;\n    // ... other members\n\npublic:\n    GameMenu() : levelOneInstance(&player) {}\n    void Run();\n};\n```\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Use either references or pointers to share the same object\n2. Pass the Player object when constructing LevelOne\n3. Make sure the Player object lives as long as it's needed by other classes\n\nRemember that when using references or pointers, the original object must remain valid for as long as other classes need to access it. In this case, the Player object in GameMenu must exist for as long as LevelOne needs to use it.\nwhat does this m,ean Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"LevelOne::Run()\", referenced from:\n      _main in main.cpp.o\n  \"LevelOne::LevelOne()\", referenced from:\n      _main in main.cpp.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64\nc++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nmake[2]: *** [polyamn] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nThis linker error means that you have declared the functions `Run()` and the constructor `LevelOne()` in your `LevelOne` class, but you haven't provided their implementations (definitions) anywhere. The linker can't find the actual code for these functions.\n\nTo fix this, you need to implement these functions either in a separate .cpp file or in the header file. Here's how to fix it:\n\nOption 1 - Implement in a separate cpp file (recommended):\n```cpp\n// LevelOne.h\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player& player;\n\npublic:\n    LevelOne(Player& playerRef);  // Declaration\n    void Run();                   // Declaration\n};\n\n// LevelOne.cpp\n#include \"LevelOne.h\"\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne(Player& playerRef) : player(playerRef) {\n    // Constructor implementation\n}\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    // Implementation of Run\n    // Your code here\n}\n```\n\nOption 2 - Implement in the header file:\n```cpp\n// LevelOne.h\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player& player;\n\npublic:\n    LevelOne(Player& playerRef) : player(playerRef) {\n        // Constructor implementation\n    }\n    \n    void Run() {\n        // Implementation of Run\n        // Your code here\n    }\n};\n```\n\nAlso, make sure that:\n1. The cpp file is included in your build system (CMakeLists.txt if you're using CMAKE)\n2. All necessary header files are included\n3. The implementations match the declarations\n\nIf you're using CMAKE, make sure your CMakeLists.txt includes all your source files:\n```cmake\nadd_executable(your_project_name\n    main.cpp\n    LevelOne.cpp\n    # other source files\n)\n```\ncan you spot the issue \n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\n\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne() : player()\n{\n\n}\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run(){\n    BeginDrawing();\n\n\n    // Update\n    player.Update();\n\n    // Collision\n\n   ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    // Draw\n    player.Draw();\n\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n\n#pragma once\n#include \"player.h\"\n\nclass LevelOne{\n    private:\n    Player player;\n\n    public:\n\n    LevelOne();\n    void Run();\n};\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"cutscene1.h\"\n\n\nCutScene::CutScene() :\ndialogOne(50, 100, 650, 100, {\n    \"Hey good brother!

First, in your LevelOne class, you're managing BeginDrawing() and EndDrawing() within the Run() method. This is problematic because you already have these calls in your main game loop. Each frame should only have one BeginDrawing() and EndDrawing() pair.\n\n2. You're clearing the background twice: once with ClearBackground(BLACK) in main and again with ClearBackground(RAYWHITE) in LevelOne::Run().\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n```cpp\n// level_one.h\n#pragma once\n#include \"player.h\"\n\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player player;\n\npublic:\n    LevelOne();\n    void Run();\n};\n\n// level_one.cpp\n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne() : player()\n{\n}\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    // Update\n    player.Update();\n\n    // Collision\n\n    // Draw\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);  // You might want to move this to main\n    player.Draw();\n}\n\n// main.cpp\nint main(void) {\n    InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"polyamn\");\n    SetTargetFPS(60);\n\n    GameMenu gamemenu;\n    CutScene sceneOne;\n    LevelOne levelOne;\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        \n        if (currentGameState == GAME_MENU) {\n            gamemenu.Run();\n        }\n        else if (currentGameState == SCENE1) {\n            sceneOne.Run();\n        }\n        else if (currentGameState == LEVEL_ONE) {\n            levelOne.Run();\n        }\n\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n    CloseWindow();\n}\n```\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Remove BeginDrawing() and EndDrawing() from LevelOne::Run()\n2. Keep these drawing calls only in the main game loop\n3. Consider moving ClearBackground() to main as well if you want consistent behavior\n\nAlso, make sure that:\n1. Your Player class is properly implemented\n2. All necessary headers are included\n3. All required textures and resources are properly loaded\n\nThis should resolve your issues.

The linker can't find the implementations of `LevelOne::Run()` and `LevelOne::LevelOne()` because the source file containing these implementations isn't being compiled.\n\nYou need to add `level_one.cpp` to your CMakeLists.txt file. It should look something like this:\n\n```cmake\nadd_executable(polyamn\n    main.cpp\n    level_one.cpp  # Add this line\n    game_menu.cpp\n    cutscene1.cpp\n    # ... other source files\n)\n```\n\nMake sure all your .cpp files are listed in the CMakeLists.txt file. The error occurs because while the compiler can see the declarations in the header file, it can't find the actual implementations during the linking phase because the cpp file isn't being compiled.\n\nAfter adding the file to CMakeLists.txt, rebuild your project:\n```bash\ncmake ..\nmake\n```\n\nThis should resolve the linker error you're seeing.\nive made some changes in a project that i have a github repository for and i want to push the changes to the repository how would i do that\n\nHere's how to push changes to your GitHub repository:\n\n1.

It's being passed in but not actually used anywhere in the class implementation. This could be:\n\n1. Either a leftover parameter from previous code\n2. Or was intended for some future use (like scaling or positioning relative to screen height)\n\nYou could safely remove it from the constructor since it's not being used:\n\n```cpp\n// Before\nButton(const char* texturePath, float x, float y, int screen_height)\n\n// After\nButton(const char* texturePath, float x, float y)\n```\n\nThen update all the places where Button objects are created to remove the screen_height argument. For example:\n\n```cpp\n// Before\nButton myButton(\"path/to/texture.png\", 100, 100, screen_height);\n\n// After\nButton myButton(\"path/to/texture.png\", 100, 100);\n```\n\nUnless there's a specific reason you need screen_height for future implementations, it can be removed to make the code cleaner and more straightforward.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1285}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":499,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1286}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":2117,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1287}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":61},"start":2543,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1288}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":4082,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1289}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":174},"start":6346,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1290}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":175},"start":8283,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1291}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":296},"start":8758,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1292}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":297},"start":9700,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1293}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":470},"start":9841,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1294}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":471},"start":11128,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1295}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1243},"start":13068,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1296}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1244},"start":14047,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1297}}}],"summary":"Sharing Player Object Between Classes","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
