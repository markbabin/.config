Here are a few potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Method Definition**: Ensure that the `recHitboxCollision` method is defined in the `Player` class. If it's not defined, the LSP will highlight it as an error.\n\n    ```cpp\n    class Player {\n    public:\n        static bool recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n        // Other members...\n    };\n    ```\n\n2. **Method Implementation**: Ensure that the `recHitboxCollision` method is implemented somewhere in your code. If it's declared but not implemented, the LSP might highlight it.\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool Player::recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n        // Implementation of the collision detection logic\n        return CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2);\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Include Directives**: Ensure that the header file where `recHitboxCollision` is declared is included in the file where you are using it.\n\n    ```cpp\n    #include \"player.h\"\n    ```\n\n4. **Namespace Issues**: If `recHitboxCollision` is in a namespace, ensure that you are using the correct namespace or have the appropriate `using` directive.\n\n    ```cpp\n    namespace MyNamespace {\n        class Player {\n        public:\n            static bool recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n            // Other members...\n        };\n    }\n\n    // Usage\n    MyNamespace::Player::recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box);\n    ```\n\n5. **Typographical Errors**: Ensure there are no typographical errors in the method name or parameters.\n\n6. **LSP Configuration**: Sometimes, the LSP might not be configured correctly or might need to be refreshed. Try restarting your editor or reloading the LSP.\n\nHere is an example of how your `Player` class and `recHitboxCollision` method might look:\n\n```cpp\n// player.h\n#ifndef PLAYER_H\n#define PLAYER_H\n\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nclass Player {\npublic:\n    Player(float x, float y, int width, int height, float speed);\n    void Update();\n    void Draw();\n    Rectangle GetCollisionBox() const;\n    static bool recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n\nprivate:\n    float x, y;\n    int width, height;\n    float speed;\n};\n\n#endif // PLAYER_H\n```\n\n```cpp\n// player.cpp\n#include \"player.h\"\n\nPlayer::Player(float x, float y, int width, int height, float speed)\n    : x(x), y(y), width(width), height(height), speed(speed) {}\n\nvoid Player::Update() {\n    // Update player position and state\n}\n\nvoid Player::Draw() {\n    // Draw player\n}\n\nRectangle Player::GetCollisionBox() const {\n    return { x, y, static_cast<float>(width), static_cast<float>(height) };\n}\n\nbool Player::recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n    return CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2);\n}\n```\n\nEnsure that your `LevelOne` class includes the `player.h` file and that the `recHitboxCollision` method is correctly defined and implemented.\n#include \"player.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nPlayer::Player(float startX, float startY, int w, int h, float spd)\n    : x(startX), y(startY), width(w), height(h), speed(spd), prevX(startX), prevY(startY) {\n        hitBox = {x, y + 24, (float)width, (float)height / 3};\n        anchorPoint = y + height;\n    }\n\n\n\nvoid Player::limitMovement(){\n    if (y <= 0) {\n      y = 0;\n    }\n    if (y + height >= GetScreenHeight()) {\n      y = GetScreenHeight() - height;\n    }\n    if (x <= 0) {\n      x = 0;\n    }\n    if (x + width >= GetScreenWidth()) {\n      x = GetScreenWidth() - height;\n    }\n}\nvoid Player::Draw(){\n    DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, hellRed);\n}\nvoid Player::Update(){\n\n    prevX = x;\n          prevY = y;\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_UP)) {\n          y -= speed;\n          hitBox.y = y + 24;\n          anchorPoint = y + height;\n        }\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_DOWN)) {\n          y += speed;\n          hitBox.y =  y + 24;\n          anchorPoint = y + height;\n        }\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_RIGHT)) {\n          x += speed;\n          hitBox.x = x;\n          anchorPoint = y + height;\n\n        }\n        if (IsKeyDown(KEY_LEFT)) {\n          x -= speed;\n          hitBox.x = x;\n          anchorPoint = y + height;\n        }\n        limitMovement();\n      }\nvoid Player::resetXY(){\n    x = prevX;\n    y = prevY;\n}\nRectangle Player::getRectangle() {\n  return Rectangle{x, y, (float)width, (float)height};\n}\nRectangle Player::GetCollisionBox(){\n    return hitBox;\n}\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n      std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX;  // ADD SPEED HERE\n         // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n#pragma once\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nclass Player {\n\nprivate:\nfloat x;\nfloat y;\nint width;\nint height;\nfloat speed;\nfloat prevX;\nfloat prevY;\nRectangle hitBox;\n\n\npublic:\nfloat anchorPoint;\nPlayer(float startX, float startY, int w, int h, float spd);\nvoid limitMovement();\nvoid Draw();\nvoid Update();\nvoid resetXY();\nRectangle getRectangle();\nRectangle GetCollisionBox();\nvoid recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2);\n\n};\n\nThank you for providing the code. From your implementation, it looks like the `recHitboxCollision` method is defined as a member function of the `Player` class. However, in your `LevelOne` class, you are calling it as a static method, which is not correct based on your current implementation.\n\nTo fix this, you have two options:\n\n1. **Call the method on an instance of the `Player` class**:\n   \n   In your `LevelOne` class, you should call `recHitboxCollision` on the `player` instance:\n\n   ```cpp\n   player.recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box);\n   ```\n\n2. **Make the method static**:\n   \n   If you want `recHitboxCollision` to be a static method (which means it can be called without an instance of `Player`), you need to declare and define it as static:\n\n   ```cpp\n   // In player.h\n   class Player {\n   public:\n       // Other members...\n       static void recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2);\n   };\n\n   // In player.cpp\n   void Player::recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2) {\n       if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n           std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n           float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                            std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n           float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                            std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n           // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n           if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n               if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                   rect1.x -= overlapX;  // ADD SPEED HERE\n                   // Push player back to the left\n               } else {\n                   rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n               }\n           } else {\n               if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                   rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n               } else {\n                   rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n               }\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Then, you can call it as a static method in your `LevelOne` class:\n\n   ```cpp\n   Player::recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box);\n   ```\n\nChoose one of these options based on your design preference. If `recHitboxCollision` logically belongs to the `Player` class and operates on instances of `Player`, the first option is more appropriate. If it is a utility function that doesn't need to operate on a specific instance of `Player`, the second option is better.\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n      std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX; \n         // ADD SPEED HERE\n         // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nhow would i set according speed here \nTo adjust the position of the player based on the speed when a collision occurs, you need to have access to the player's speed within the `recHitboxCollision` function. Since `recHitboxCollision` is a member function of the `Player` class, you can directly use the `speed` member variable of the `Player` instance.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `recHitboxCollision` function to account for the player's speed:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n        float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                         std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n        float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                         std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n        // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n        if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n            if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                rect1.x -= overlapX + speed;  // Push player back to the left with speed adjustment\n            } else {\n                rect1.x += overlapX + speed;  // Push player back to the right with speed adjustment\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                rect1.y -= overlapY + speed;  // Push rect1 back up with speed adjustment\n            } else {\n                rect1.y += overlapY + speed;  // Push player back down with speed adjustment\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `speed` is added to the overlap amount when adjusting the position of `rect1` (which represents the player's hitbox). This ensures that the player is pushed back by an amount that includes their speed, making the collision response more realistic.\n\nHowever, if you want to ensure that the player is pushed back by exactly the amount of overlap (without adding the speed), you can simply use the overlap values without adding the speed:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n        float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                         std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n        float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                         std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n        // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n        if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n            if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                rect1.x -= overlapX;  // Push player back to the left\n            } else {\n                rect1.x += overlapX;  // Push player back to the right\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                rect1.y -= overlapY;  // Push rect1 back up\n            } else {\n                rect1.y += overlapY;  // Push player back down\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your game's mechanics and desired collision response behavior.\nthis code doesnt work it prints the cout so it works until there for sure but other than that it doesnt block the player from moving into the other hitbox\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n      std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX;\n         // ADD SPEED HERE\n         // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTo ensure that the player is properly blocked from moving into another hitbox, you need to adjust the player's position directly rather than just modifying the `rect1` rectangle. The `rect1` rectangle is a local copy, and modifying it won't affect the player's actual position.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `recHitboxCollision` function to directly adjust the player's position:\n\n1. **Pass the Player's Position**: Instead of passing `rect1` and `rect2`, pass the player's position and the other rectangle.\n2. **Adjust the Player's Position**: Directly modify the player's position based on the collision.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &playerRect, Rectangle &otherRect) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(playerRect, otherRect)) {\n        std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n        float overlapX = std::min(playerRect.x + playerRect.width, otherRect.x + otherRect.width) -\n                         std::max(playerRect.x, otherRect.x);\n        float overlapY = std::min(playerRect.y + playerRect.height, otherRect.y + otherRect.height) -\n                         std::max(playerRect.y, otherRect.y);\n\n        // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n        if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n            if (playerRect.x < otherRect.x) {\n                x -= overlapX;  // Push player back to the left\n            } else {\n                x += overlapX;  // Push player back to the right\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (playerRect.y < otherRect.y) {\n                y -= overlapY;  // Push player back up\n            } else {\n                y += overlapY;  // Push player back down\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Update the player's hitbox position\n        hitBox.x = x;\n        hitBox.y = y + 24;\n        anchorPoint = y + height;\n    \n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `x` and `y` are the player's position variables. When a collision is detected, the player's position is adjusted directly. After adjusting the position, the player's hitbox and anchor point are updated to reflect the new position.\n\nMake sure to call this function with the player's collision box and the other object's collision box:\n\n```cpp\nRectangle playerBox = player.GetCollisionBox();\nRectangle tree1Box = tree1.GetCollisionBox();\n\nplayer.recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box);\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the player is properly blocked from moving into the other hitbox.\nthe code now pushes the player into opposite direction when collided but it also prevents him from going over the hitbox which is what i want i just dont want him to get pushed into the opposite direction\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n      std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        x -= overlapX;\n         // ADD SPEED HERE\n         // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\nTo prevent the player from being pushed in the opposite direction while still blocking them from moving into the other hitbox, you need to adjust the player's position only to the point of collision without adding any extra movement. This means you should move the player back to the edge of the other hitbox rather than pushing them further away.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `recHitboxCollision` function to achieve this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Player::recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &playerRect, Rectangle &otherRect) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(playerRect, otherRect)) {\n        std::cout << \"collision works\" << std::endl;\n        float overlapX = std::min(playerRect.x + playerRect.width, otherRect.x + otherRect.width) -\n                         std::max(playerRect.x, otherRect.x);\n        float overlapY = std::min(playerRect.y + playerRect.height, otherRect.y + otherRect.height) -\n                         std::max(playerRect.y, otherRect.y);\n\n        // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n        if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n            if (playerRect.x < otherRect.x) {\n                x = otherRect.x - playerRect.width;  // Move player to the left edge of the otherRect\n            } else {\n                x = otherRect.x + otherRect.width;  // Move player to the right edge of the otherRect\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (playerRect.y < otherRect.y) {\n                y = otherRect.y - playerRect.height;  // Move player to the top edge of the otherRect\n            } else {\n                y = otherRect.y + otherRect.height;  // Move player to the bottom edge of the otherRect\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Update the player's hitbox position\n        hitBox.x = x;\n        hitBox.y = y + 24;\n        anchorPoint = y + height;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, instead of adding or subtracting the overlap amount, the player's position is set directly to the edge of the other rectangle. This ensures that the player is blocked from moving into the other hitbox without being pushed in the opposite direction.\n\nMake sure to call this function with the player's collision box and the other object's collision box:\n\n```cpp\nRectangle playerBox = player.GetCollisionBox();\nRectangle tree1Box = tree1.GetCollisionBox();\n\nplayer.recHitboxCollision(playerBox, tree1Box);\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the player is properly blocked from moving into the other hitbox without being pushed in the opposite direction.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":806}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":1744,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":807}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":4779,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":808}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":77},"start":7648,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":809}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":78},"start":10149,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":810}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":170},"start":11095,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":811}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":171},"start":14156,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":812}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":348},"start":15219,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":813}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":349},"start":17635,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":814}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":693},"start":18721,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":815}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":694},"start":21164,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":816}}}],"summary":"LSP Highlighting Collision Function Issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
