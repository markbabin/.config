The vector is declared outside of any class or function scope (it appears to be at global scope)\n2. It's just a declaration without proper initialization\n\nHere are the correct ways to declare the vector, depending on your needs:\n\n1. If you want it as a member of the LevelOne class:\n```cpp\n// In level_one.h\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate: // or public depending on your needs\n    std::vector<Rectangle*> drawOrder;\n    // ... other members\n};\n```\n\n2. If you want it as a local variable inside the Run() function:\n```cpp\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    std::vector<Rectangle*> drawOrder;\n    BeginDrawing();\n    // ... rest of the code\n}\n```\n\n3. If you really need it as a global variable (generally not recommended):\n```cpp\n// At global scope, preferably in the cpp file\nstatic std::vector<Rectangle*> drawOrder;\n```\n\nAlso, don't forget to include the vector header:\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n```\n\nThe most common and recommended approach would be to make it a member variable of your LevelOne class (#1 above), as this keeps the data properly encapsulated within the class.\nokay i will declare it under public in my level one.h file buit how do i declare it in this file \nIf you've declared the vector in your level_one.h file as a class member, you don't need to declare it again in the .cpp file. You can simply use it directly through the class instance using `this->drawOrder` or just `drawOrder`. \n\nHere's how you can use it in your level_one.cpp file:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne() :\n    player(),\n    tree1(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree2(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree3(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree4(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0})\n{\n    // If you want to initialize the vector with some values, you can do it here\n    drawOrder.push_back(&someRectangle);\n}\n    \nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n    // You can use drawOrder directly here\n    for(auto rect : drawOrder) {\n        // Do something with rect\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nRemember that since it's already declared as a member variable in your header file, you just use it directly in your implementation file. You don't need to declare it again.\n\nIf you need to add elements to the vector, you can use methods like `push_back()`, `emplace_back()`, etc.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":107}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":594,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":108}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":1730,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":109}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":89},"start":1828,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":110}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":90},"start":3155,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":111}}}],"summary":"Vector Declaration Syntax Question","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
