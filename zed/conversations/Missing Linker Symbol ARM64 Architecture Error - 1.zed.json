Here's what's happening:\n\n1. The linker (`ld`) cannot find the definition of a variable named `_currentDialogState`\n2. This variable is being referenced in multiple places within `cutscene1.cpp`:\n   - In `CutScene::Run()` (referenced twice)\n   - In `DialogWindow::Update()`\n3. The error is specifically for the ARM64 architecture\n\nThis error typically occurs when:\n1. You've declared a variable but haven't defined it anywhere\n2. The variable is defined in another source file but isn't properly linked\n3. The variable might be declared as `extern` but its actual definition is missing\n\nTo fix this, you should:\n1. Make sure `_currentDialogState` is actually defined somewhere in your code\n2. Check if you need to include the correct header file\n3. Ensure the file containing the definition is being compiled and linked\n4. Verify the variable's declaration and definition match in terms of type and linkage\n\nCould you show:\n1. Where `_currentDialogState` is declared?\n2. Where it's supposed to be defined?\n3. The relevant parts of your CMake configuration?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":35}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":472,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":36}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":1610,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":37}}}],"summary":"Missing Linker Symbol ARM64 Architecture Error","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
