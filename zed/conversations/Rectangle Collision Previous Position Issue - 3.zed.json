Create a custom Rectangle class that extends the built-in Rectangle to include prevX and prevY:\n\n```cpp\nclass ExtendedRectangle : public Rectangle {\npublic:\n    float prevX;\n    float prevY;\n    \n    ExtendedRectangle(float x, float y, float width, float height) : Rectangle{x, y, width, height} {\n        prevX = x;\n        prevY = y;\n    }\n};\n\nbool CheckCollision(ExtendedRectangle& Rect1, ExtendedRectangle& Rect2) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(\n        Rectangle{Rect1.x, Rect1.y, Rect1.width, Rect1.height},\n        Rectangle{Rect2.x, Rect2.y, Rect2.width, Rect2.height})) {\n        \n        Rect1.x = Rect1.prevX;\n        Rect1.y = Rect1.prevY;\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n2. Create a separate structure to track position history:\n\n```cpp\nstruct Position {\n    Rectangle rect;\n    float prevX;\n    float prevY;\n};\n\nbool CheckCollision(Position& Pos1, Position& Pos2) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(Pos1.rect, Pos2.rect)) {\n        Pos1.rect.x = Pos1.prevX;\n        Pos1.rect.y = Pos1.prevY;\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n3. Store the previous position before moving the rectangle and pass it to the function:\n\n```cpp\nbool CheckCollision(Rectangle& Rect1, Rectangle& Rect2, float prevX, float prevY) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(Rect1, Rect2)) {\n        Rect1.x = prevX;\n        Rect1.y = prevY;\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nUsage example for option 1:\n```cpp\nExtendedRectangle player(100, 100, 50, 50);\nExtendedRectangle wall(200, 200, 100, 20);\n\n// Before moving the player\nplayer.prevX = player.x;\nplayer.prevY = player.y;\n\n// Move player\nplayer.x += moveX;\nplayer.y += moveY;\n\n// Check collision\nCheckCollision(player, wall);\n```\n\nI would recommend using option 1 (ExtendedRectangle) as it keeps all the related data together and is the most organized solution. Just remember to update prevX and prevY before moving the rectangle.\n bool CheckCollision(Rectangle& Rect1, Rectangle& Rect2, float& prevX, float& prevY) {\n      if (CheckCollisionRecs(\n          Rectangle{Rect1.x, Rect1.y, Rect1.width, Rect1.height},\n          Rectangle{Rect2.x, Rect2.y, Rect2.width, Rect2.height})) {\n\n          Rect1.x = prevX;\n          Rect1.y = prevY;\n          return true;\n      }\n      return false;\n  }\nwouldnt this also be a solution \nYes, that's absolutely a valid solution! This is similar to option 3 I mentioned, and it's a perfectly good way to handle the collision detection and position restoration. The main advantages of this approach are:\n\n1. It's simple and straightforward\n2. You don't need to create any new classes or structures\n3. It works with the standard Rectangle type\n4. It's flexible since you're passing the previous position as parameters\n\nYou would use it like this:\n```cpp\nRectangle player = {100, 100, 50, 50};\nRectangle wall = {200, 200, 100, 20};\nfloat prevX = player.x;\nfloat prevY = player.y;\n\n// Move player\nplayer.x += moveX;\nplayer.y += moveY;\n\n// Check collision\nCheckCollision(player, wall, prevX, prevY);\n```\n\nThe only thing to remember is to always update prevX and prevY before moving the rectangle. As long as you're consistent with that, this is a perfectly fine solution!\nso whenever id need to pass in the paramaters value i could just pass x and y for the prevX and prevY and it would work right?\nYes, exactly! If you want to use the current position as the previous position, you can just pass the current x and y values before making any movement. For example:\n\n```cpp\nRectangle player = {100, 100, 50, 50};\nRectangle wall = {200, 200, 100, 20};\n\n// Pass current x,y as prevX,prevY before moving\nCheckCollision(player, wall, player.x, player.y);\n\n// Or in your game loop:\nwhile(gameRunning) {\n    // Store current position before movement\n    float prevX = player.x;\n    float prevY = player.y;\n\n    // Move player\n    player.x += moveX;\n    player.y += moveY;\n\n    // Check collision using stored position\n    CheckCollision(player, wall, prevX, prevY);\n}\n```\n\nThis will make the rectangle return to its position before the movement if a collision occurs. It's a simple and effective way to handle basic collision response!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":274}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":40},"start":524,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":275}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":41},"start":2473,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":276}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":128},"start":2868,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":277}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":129},"start":3746,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":278}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":236},"start":3873,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":279}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":237},"start":4703,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":280}}}],"summary":"Rectangle Collision Previous Position Issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
