First, delete the existing build folder (from your project root):\n```bash\nrm -rf build/\n```\n\n2. Create a new build directory:\n```bash\nmkdir build\n```\n\n3. Navigate into the build directory:\n```bash\ncd build\n```\n\n4. Run CMake to generate build files:\n```bash\ncmake ..\n```\n\n5. Build the project:\n```bash\ncmake --build .\n```\n\nOr you can do it as a one-liner:\n```bash\nG .\n```\n\nAdditional options:\n- To specify a build type: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`\n- To use specific generator: `cmake -G \"Generator Name\" ..`\n- To build with multiple cores: `cmake --build . -j4` (where 4 is number of cores)\n- To clean build: `cmake --build . --target clean`\n\nRemember to run these commands from your project's root directory where your main CMakeLists.txt file is located.\n cant add git changes to my repository markbabin@MacBook-Pro build % git add .\n The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\n build\n markbabin@MacBook-Pro build %\nThis is actually expected behavior! The `build` directory is typically ignored in Git repositories by default through the `.gitignore` file, and this is considered best practice. Here's why:\n\n1. The `build` directory contains compiled code and temporary build files that should be generated on each machine\n2. These files can be large and aren't necessary to track in version control\n3. Different machines/environments might generate different build files\n\nIf you want to add changes to Git, you should:\n\n1. First, navigate back to your project root directory:\n```bash\ncd ..\n```\n\n2. Then add your changes from there:\n```bash\ngit add .\n```\n\nYou should focus on tracking:\n- Source code files (`.cpp`, `.h`, etc.)\n- CMakeLists.txt files\n- Resource files\n- Documentation\n- Configuration files\n\nBut NOT the contents of the `build` directory.\n\nIf you really need to force add files from the build directory (not recommended), you can use:\n```bash\ngit add -f build/\n```\n\nBut again, this is generally not recommended for C++ projects using CMake.\nthis makes pressing the quit button break the game with infinite display of this msg in termninal WARNING: GLFW: Error: 65537 Description: The GLFW library is not initialized\n#include \"title_screen.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\n\nTitleScreen::TitleScreen() :\n    playBtn(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/PlayBtn.png\", 117, 475, screen_height),\n    settingsBtn(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/SettingsButton.png\", 390, 475, screen_height),\n    quitBtn(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/QuitBtn.png\", 640, 475, screen_height)\n\n    {\n    bg = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/TitleScreen.png\");\n    }\n\nvoid TitleScreen::Run(){\n\n    BeginDrawing();\n\n    DrawTexture(bg, 0, 0, WHITE);\n    playBtn.Draw();\n    settingsBtn.Draw();\n    quitBtn.Draw();\n\n    playBtn.Update();\n    settingsBtn.Update();\n    quitBtn.Update();\n\n    if (playBtn.IsClicked()){\n        currentGameState = GAME_MENU;\n    }\n    if (quitBtn.IsClicked()){\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n\nThe issue occurs because `CloseWindow()` is immediately closing the GLFW window, but your game loop continues to try to render frames. To fix this, you need to set a flag that will properly exit the game loop instead of directly calling `CloseWindow()`. Here's how to modify your code:\n\n1. First, add a boolean flag in your `globals.h`:\n```cpp\nextern bool shouldCloseGame;  // Add this declaration\n```\n\n2. Define the variable in your `globals.cpp`:\n```cpp\nbool shouldCloseGame = false;  // Add this definition\n```\n\n3. Modify your TitleScreen.cpp:\n```cpp\nvoid TitleScreen::Run(){\n    BeginDrawing();\n\n    DrawTexture(bg, 0, 0, WHITE);\n    playBtn.Draw();\n    settingsBtn.Draw();\n    quitBtn.Draw();\n\n    playBtn.Update();\n    settingsBtn.Update();\n    quitBtn.Update();\n\n    if (playBtn.IsClicked()){\n        currentGameState = GAME_MENU;\n    }\n    if (quitBtn.IsClicked()){\n        shouldCloseGame = true;  // Set the flag instead of calling CloseWindow()\n    }\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\n4. In your main game loop (usually in main.cpp), modify it to check for this flag:\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    InitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"Your Game\");\n    \n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose() && !shouldCloseGame)  // Add check for shouldCloseGame\n    {\n        // Your game loop content\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();  // Close the window after the loop ends\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that:\n1. The game loop exits properly\n2. All resources are cleaned up in order\n3. The window is closed at the appropriate time\n4. You don't get the GLFW errors from trying to draw to a closed window\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":304}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":73,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":305}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":26},"start":908,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":306}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":81},"start":1091,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":307}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":82},"start":2130,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":308}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":259},"start":3215,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":309}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":260},"start":4847,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":310}}}],"summary":"CMake Build Directory Regeneration Steps","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
