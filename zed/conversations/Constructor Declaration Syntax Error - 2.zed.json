There's an extra comma after `float y` in the parameter list\n2. The constructor parameters are shadowing the class member variables but aren't being used\n\nHere's the corrected version:\n\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\nclass Obstacle {\npublic:\n    float height = 250;\n    float width = height;\n    float x = 0;\n    float y = screen_height / 2;\n    \n    // Constructor - remove the extra comma and initialize member variables\n    Obstacle(float x_pos, float y_pos) {\n        x = x_pos;\n        y = y_pos;\n    }\n\n    // Default constructor if you need one\n    Obstacle() = default;\n\n    void Draw() {\n        DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, BLACK);\n    }\n};\n\nObstacle obs1; // This will use the default constructor\n```\n\nOr alternatively, you can use the constructor initialization list:\n\n```cpp\nObstacle(float x_pos, float y_pos) : x(x_pos), y(y_pos) {}\n```\n\nAlso, if you want to create an obstacle with specific coordinates, you should use:\n\n```cpp\nObstacle obs1(100, 200); // Example with specific x and y coordinates\n```\nwhat does this error mean c++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nmake[2]: *** [reasings] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/reasings.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nThis linker error typically occurs when there are issues with how your program's files are being linked together during compilation. Common causes include:\n\n1. Missing implementation of declared functions\n2. Multiple definitions of the same function/variable\n3. Missing source files in your CMake configuration\n4. Undefined references to functions or variables\n\nTo debug this, you should:\n\n1. Run the build with verbose output (`make VERBOSE=1` or use `-v` as suggested)\n2. Check if all your .cpp files are included in your CMakeLists.txt\n3. Make sure you're not defining functions or variables in header files without `inline` or `static`\n4. Verify that all declared functions have implementations\n\nCould you share:\n1. Your CMakeLists.txt file\n2. The complete error message (there should be more specific error messages above the linker error)\n3. Your project structure (which files you have and where they are located)\n\nThis would help identify the specific cause of the linking error in your case.\nmy rec has  x 200 and y 200 and is in upper lef corner what would x nd y values of an invrted rec be in the lower right corner of a 1280x800 screen\nFor a rectangle with dimensions 200x200 to be positioned in the lower right corner of a 1280x800 screen, you would calculate:\n\nX position = screen width - rectangle width = 1280 - 200 = 1080\nY position = screen height - rectangle height = 800 - 200 = 600\n\nSo the coordinates would be:\nx = 1080\ny = 600\n\nThis positions the rectangle so its upper-left corner is at (1080,600), making the rectangle appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen with 200 pixels of width and height.\n\nVisual representation:\n```\n(0,0)        Screen (1280x800)         (1280,0)\n   +--------------------------------+\n   |                                |\n   |                                |\n   |                      (1080,600)|\n   |                          +---+ |\n   |                          |   | |\n   |                          |   | |\n   |                          +---+ |\n   +--------------------------------+\n(0,800)                        (1280,800)\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":352}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":378,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":353}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":1500,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":354}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":74},"start":1711,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":355}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":75},"start":2712,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":356}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":307},"start":2860,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":357}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":308},"start":3805,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":358}}}],"summary":"Constructor Declaration Syntax Error","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
