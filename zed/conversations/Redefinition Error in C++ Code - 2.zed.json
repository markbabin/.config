In your `globals.h` file, you declare `currentGameState` as a global variable, and then in your `globals.cpp` file, you define it again. This leads to a redefinition error.\n\nTo fix this, you should declare the variable as `extern` in the header file and define it in the source file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n**globals.h:**\n```cpp\n#pragma once\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nconst int screen_width = 960;\nconst int screen_height = 560;\n\nenum gameState { DICE };\n\nextern gameState currentGameState; // Declare as extern\n```\n\n**globals.cpp:**\n```cpp\n#include \"globals.h\"\n\ngameState currentGameState = DICE; // Define the variable\n```\n\nBy declaring `currentGameState` as `extern` in the header file, you inform the compiler that the variable is defined elsewhere, which resolves the redefinition error. The actual definition of the variable is then provided in the source file (`globals.cpp`).\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":94}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":42},"start":359,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":95}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":43},"start":1335,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":96}}}],"summary":"Redefinition Error in C++ Code","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
