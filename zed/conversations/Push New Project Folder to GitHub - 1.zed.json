First, add the folder to git tracking:\n```bash\ngit add your-new-folder/\n```\n\n2. Commit the changes:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Add new folder\"\n```\n\n3. Push to GitHub:\n```bash\ngit push origin main  # or whatever your branch name is\n```\n\nAlternative method (if you want to be more specific):\n```bash\n# Add all files in the new folder\ngit add your-new-folder/*\n\n# Commit\ngit commit -m \"Add new folder and its contents\"\n\n# Push\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nImportant notes:\n- Make sure the folder isn't in your .gitignore file\n- If the folder is empty, Git won't track it unless you add a file in it (like a .gitkeep file)\n- If you want to push changes to a specific branch, replace 'main' with your branch name\n\nIf you want to push just that folder and ignore other changes:\n```bash\ngit add your-new-folder/\ngit commit -m \"Add new folder\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":43}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":114,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":23},"start":1020,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}}],"summary":"Push New Project Folder to GitHub","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
