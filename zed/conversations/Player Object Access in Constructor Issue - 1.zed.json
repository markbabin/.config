In your header file (`shop.h`), you should declare it as:\n\n```cpp\nclass Shop {\npublic:\n    Shop();\n    void Run();\n    void PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo);  // Add this to class declaration\nprivate:\n    std::string ReturnRandCombo(const std::vector<std::string>& combos);\n    Player player;\n    // ... other member variables\n};\n```\n\nAnd in your implementation file (`shop.cpp`), define it as:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo) {\n    // Now you can access player\n    player.someMethod();  // This will work\n}\n```\n\nThe current implementation shows `PurchaseCombo` as a free function (not part of any class), which is why it can't access the `player` member variable. By making it a member function of the `Shop` class, it will have access to all member variables, including `player`.\n\nAlso, make sure that the `Player` class is properly included and that `player` is correctly declared as a member variable in your `Shop` class header file.\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price\n\n}\nmy struct also constains int price why does it not let me reference it here \nThe issue is with how you're trying to access the `price` member. You're passing a `std::vector<ComboData>` as the parameter, but trying to access `price` directly from the vector. A vector is a collection of `ComboData` objects, so you need to specify which element of the vector you want to access.\n\nIf you want to check the price of a specific combo, you should either:\n\n1. Pass a single `ComboData` instead of a vector:\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo) {\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Or specify which element of the vector you want to check:\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo) {\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo[0].price) {  // Checks first combo in vector\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure your `ComboData` struct is properly defined with the `price` member:\n```cpp\nstruct ComboData {\n    std::string name;\n    int price;\n    // other members...\n};\n```\n\nBased on your previous code, it seems you might want to use the `fullCombo` member variable you already have, so you might want to do:\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo() {\n    if (player.getGold() >= fullCombo.price) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n        \n    }\ni want to push back the combo to a vector of comboData in player accessed by getcomboVector how would i do that \nTo add the combo to the player's combo vector, you can use the `pushCombo` method from the Player class (or a similar method name you're using). Assuming you have a method in the Player class to add combos, it would look something like this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n        player.getComboVector().push_back(combo);  // Option 1\n        // OR\n        player.pushCombo(combo);  // Option 2 (preferred)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe second option (using a dedicated method like `pushCombo`) is generally better practice as it maintains encapsulation. In your Player class, you would have something like:\n\n```cpp\nclass Player {\npublic:\n    void pushCombo(ComboData combo) {\n        comboVector.push_back(combo);\n    }\n    // ...\nprivate:\n    std::vector<ComboData> comboVector;\n};\n```\n\nThis is safer than directly modifying the vector through a getter method because it keeps the internal representation of the data structure private while providing a controlled way to modify it.\ncan you see why the purchase is not working (it doesnt print the cout statement but it should since )","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":296}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":1298,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":297}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":2571,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":298}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":88},"start":2747,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":299}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":89},"start":3950,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":300}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":181},"start":4163,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":301}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":182},"start":5197,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":302}}}],"summary":"Player Object Access in Constructor Issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
