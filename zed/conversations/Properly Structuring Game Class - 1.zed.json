In other words, the constructor block should have its own opening and closing braces, and then the method definition should appear after that. Make sure each function is enclosed by matching braces and that there are no nested function definitions within the constructor.\nin zed editor how do you search across all project files\nIn Zed editor, you can search across all project files by using the \"Find in Files\" feature. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the Command Palette**: You can open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).\n\n2. **Search for \"Find in Files\"**: Start typing \"Find in Files\" in the command palette, and you should see an option like \"Find in Files\" or \"Search in Files\".\n\n3. **Enter Your Search Query**: Once you select \"Find in Files\", a search bar will appear where you can enter the text you want to search for across all files in your project.\n\n4. **Review Results**: The search results will be displayed, showing all occurrences of the search term in your project files.\n\nThis feature allows you to quickly locate and navigate to specific code snippets or text within your entire project.\ndo you know what resolution celeste has\nYes, the game \"Celeste\" runs at a resolution of 320x180 pixels, which is then upscaled to fit modern displays. This resolution gives the game its distinct pixel art style while maintaining a retro aesthetic. The game is designed to scale well to higher resolutions while preserving the original pixel art look.\nwhat do you think the character sprite resolution is in that game\n\nIn \"Celeste,\" the main character, Madeline, has a sprite resolution of approximately 16x32 pixels. This size allows for detailed animations and expressive movements while maintaining the game's pixel art style. The relatively small sprite size is consistent with the game's overall aesthetic and helps to create a cohesive visual experience.\ni know raylib uses a sort of a name for colors i.e BLUE but what if i want to use a specific color how would i declare it?\n\nIn raylib, you can define a specific color by using the `Color` structure, which allows you to specify the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) components of the color. Each component is an integer value between 0 and 255. Here’s how you can declare a specific color:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialization\n    const int screenWidth = 800;\n    const int screenHeight = 450;\n\n    InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, \"raylib - custom color example\");\n\n    // Define a custom color\n    Color customColor = { 123, 234, 45, 255 }; // RGB: (123, 234, 45), Alpha: 255 (opaque)\n\n    SetTargetFPS(60); // Set our game to run at 60 frames-per-second\n\n    // Main game loop\n    while (!WindowShouldClose()) { // Detect window close button or ESC key\n        // Start drawing\n        BeginDrawing();\n\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE); // Clear the background with a white color\n\n        // Use the custom color to draw a rectangle\n        DrawRectangle(200, 200, 400, 200, customColor);\n\n        EndDrawing();\n        // End drawing\n    }\n\n    // De-Initialization\n    CloseWindow(); // Close window and OpenGL context\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `customColor` is defined with specific RGB values (123, 234, 45) and an alpha value of 255 (fully opaque). You can then use this custom color in your drawing functions, such as `DrawRectangle`, `DrawCircle`, etc.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":535}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":176,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":536}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":537,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":537}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":51},"start":594,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":538}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":52},"start":1433,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":539}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":99},"start":1473,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":540}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":100},"start":1784,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":541}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":193},"start":1851,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":542}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":194},"start":2193,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":543}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":466},"start":2317,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":544}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":467},"start":3712,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":545}}}],"summary":"Properly Structuring Game Class","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
