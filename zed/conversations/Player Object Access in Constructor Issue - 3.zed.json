In your header file (`shop.h`), you should declare it as:\n\n```cpp\nclass Shop {\npublic:\n    Shop();\n    void Run();\n    void PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo);  // Add this to class declaration\nprivate:\n    std::string ReturnRandCombo(const std::vector<std::string>& combos);\n    Player player;\n    // ... other member variables\n};\n```\n\nAnd in your implementation file (`shop.cpp`), define it as:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo) {\n    // Now you can access player\n    player.someMethod();  // This will work\n}\n```\n\nThe current implementation shows `PurchaseCombo` as a free function (not part of any class), which is why it can't access the `player` member variable. By making it a member function of the `Shop` class, it will have access to all member variables, including `player`.\n\nAlso, make sure that the `Player` class is properly included and that `player` is correctly declared as a member variable in your `Shop` class header file.\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price\n\n}\nmy struct also constains int price why does it not let me reference it here \nThe issue is with how you're trying to access the `price` member. You're passing a `std::vector<ComboData>` as the parameter, but trying to access `price` directly from the vector. A vector is a collection of `ComboData` objects, so you need to specify which element of the vector you want to access.\n\nIf you want to check the price of a specific combo, you should either:\n\n1. Pass a single `ComboData` instead of a vector:\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo) {\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Or specify which element of the vector you want to check:\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(std::vector<ComboData> combo) {\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo[0].price) {  // Checks first combo in vector\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure your `ComboData` struct is properly defined with the `price` member:\n```cpp\nstruct ComboData {\n    std::string name;\n    int price;\n    // other members...\n};\n```\n\nBased on your previous code, it seems you might want to use the `fullCombo` member variable you already have, so you might want to do:\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo() {\n    if (player.getGold() >= fullCombo.price) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n        \n    }\ni want to push back the combo to a vector of comboData in player accessed by getcomboVector how would i do that \nTo add the combo to the player's combo vector, you can use the `pushCombo` method from the Player class (or a similar method name you're using). Assuming you have a method in the Player class to add combos, it would look something like this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n        player.getComboVector().push_back(combo);  // Option 1\n        // OR\n        player.pushCombo(combo);  // Option 2 (preferred)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe second option (using a dedicated method like `pushCombo`) is generally better practice as it maintains encapsulation. In your Player class, you would have something like:\n\n```cpp\nclass Player {\npublic:\n    void pushCombo(ComboData combo) {\n        comboVector.push_back(combo);\n    }\n    // ...\nprivate:\n    std::vector<ComboData> comboVector;\n};\n```\n\nThis is safer than directly modifying the vector through a getter method because it keeps the internal representation of the data structure private while providing a controlled way to modify it.\ncan you see why the purchase is not working (it doesnt print the cout statement but it should since all combo prices are currently at 0)\n#include \"shop.h\"\n#include \"combo.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"player.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include <random>\n\nShop::Shop() : comboWindow(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/shop_combo_window.png\", 128, 106, 0),\n               back(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/backBTN.png\", 13, 13, 0),\n               player(\"player1\", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n{\n\n     InitializeCombos();\n     randomCombo = ReturnRandCombo(combos);\n     comboName = shopComboMap[randomCombo].name;\n     fullCombo = shopComboMap[randomCombo];\n\n\n\n}\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n       player.getComboVector().push_back(combo);\n       std::cout << combo.name << \"purchased!\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n}\n\nvoid Shop::Run(){\n\n    BeginDrawing();\nstd::cout << comboName << std::endl;\n    comboWindow.Update();\n    back.Update();\n\n    comboWindow.Draw();\n    DrawText(comboName.c_str(), 155, 200, 16, BLACK);\n    back.Draw();\n\n    if (back.IsClicked()){\n        currentGameState = BATTLE_PHASE;\n    }\n    if (comboWindow.IsClicked()){\n        PurchaseCombo(fullCombo);\n    }\n\n    EndDrawing();\n\n\n\n}\nstd::string Shop::ReturnRandCombo(const std::vector<std::string>& combos){\n   std::random_device rd;\n   std::mt19937 gen(rd());\n   std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(0, combos.size() - 1);\n\n   return combos[dis(gen)];\n}\n\nThe issue might be with the `IsClicked()` method of your comboWindow sprite. Let's verify a few things:\n\n1. First, add a debug print statement in the click condition to see if it's even being triggered:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::Run(){\n    BeginDrawing();\n    \n    comboWindow.Update();\n    back.Update();\n\n    comboWindow.Draw();\n    DrawText(comboName.c_str(), 155, 200, 16, BLACK);\n    back.Draw();\n\n    if (back.IsClicked()){\n        currentGameState = BATTLE_PHASE;\n    }\n    if (comboWindow.IsClicked()){\n        std::cout << \"Window clicked!\" << std::endl;  // Add this debug line\n        PurchaseCombo(fullCombo);\n    }\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\n2. Also, make sure your `IsClicked()` method is properly checking the mouse position against the sprite's position and dimensions. A typical implementation might look like:\n\n```cpp\nbool Sprite::IsClicked() {\n    Vector2 mousePos = GetMousePosition();\n    return (IsMouseButtonPressed(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON) &&\n            mousePos.x >= x && mousePos.x <= x + width &&\n            mousePos.y >= y && mousePos.y <= y + height);\n}\n```\n\n3. Verify that comboWindow's position and dimensions are correct and that you can actually click within its bounds.\n\n4. You might also want to add debug information about the player's gold and combo price:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    std::cout << \"Player gold: \" << player.getGold() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Combo price: \" << combo.price << std::endl;\n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n        player.getComboVector().push_back(combo);\n        std::cout << combo.name << \" purchased!\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf none of these reveal the issue, could you check:\n1. Is the comboWindow sprite's collision detection working properly?\n2. Are you able to click within the bounds of the comboWindow?\n3. Is the mouse input being detected correctly in other parts of your game?\nthe click works but the function purchase combo seems to be fully fucked\nLet's debug the `PurchaseCombo` function. There might be a few issues:\n\n1. The Player object might be getting reset each time because it's created in the Shop constructor. You probably want to pass a reference to the actual game's Player object instead.\n\n2. Let's add more debug statements and modify the function:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Shop::PurchaseCombo(ComboData combo){\n    std::cout << \"Purchase function called\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Player gold: \" << player.getGold() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Combo price: \" << combo.price << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Combo name: \" << combo.name << std::endl;\n    \n    if (player.getGold() >= combo.price){\n        try {\n            player.pushCombo(combo);  // Use a dedicated method instead of direct vector access\n            std::cout << combo.name << \" purchased!\" << std::endl;\n        } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n            std::cout << \"Error during purchase: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n        }\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Not enough gold!\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, in your Shop class, you probably want to modify how the Player is handled. Instead of creating a new Player in the constructor, you should pass a reference to the existing Player:\n\n```cpp\nclass Shop {\npublic:\n    Shop(Player& playerRef) : \n        comboWindow(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/shop_combo_window.png\", 128, 106, 0),\n        back(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/Simoncello/sprites/backBTN.png\", 13, 13, 0),\n        player(playerRef)  // Store reference to existing player\n    {\n        InitializeCombos();\n        randomCombo = ReturnRandCombo(combos);\n        comboName = shopComboMap[randomCombo].name;\n        fullCombo = shopComboMap[randomCombo];\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    Player& player;  // Reference to player\n    // ... other members\n};\n```\n\nThen when creating the Shop, pass the actual player:\n```cpp\nPlayer gamePlayer(\"player1\", 100, 0, 0, 0, 0);  // Create player with some initial gold\nShop shop(gamePlayer);  // Pass player to shop\n```\n\nThis way, you're working with the actual player object instead of a temporary copy.\nso the if statement doesnt pass  ive added a print in else and it prints \n\nso the if statement doesnt pass  ive added a print in else and it prints ","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":627}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":1298,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":628}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":2571,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":629}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":88},"start":2747,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":630}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":89},"start":3950,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":631}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":181},"start":4163,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":632}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":182},"start":5197,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":633}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":338},"start":6733,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":634}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":339},"start":8623,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":635}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":465},"start":8696,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":636}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":466},"start":10825,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":637}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":611},"start":10899,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"error sending request for url (https://llm.zed.dev/completion?)\nclient error (Connect)\noperation timed out"},"timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":638}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":612},"start":10900,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":639}}}],"summary":"Player Object Access in Constructor Issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
