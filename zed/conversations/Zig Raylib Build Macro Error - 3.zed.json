Each function has its own scope, so the parameter names are independent of each other and won't conflict, even if they're identical.\n\nThis is perfectly valid:\n```cpp\nvoid handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\nvoid recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n```\n\nThe parameter names only need to be unique within each function's scope. They can be reused across different functions without any issues. In fact, using consistent parameter names across related functions can make your code more readable and maintainable, especially when the parameters represent similar things.\nvoid recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX; // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nis it okay to create a rec utilty function like this \nYes, it's perfectly fine and actually a good practice to create utility functions like this for handling rectangle collision resolution. This function implements a basic Minimum Translation Vector (MTV) approach for collision resolution, which is a common technique.\n\nA few observations about your implementation:\n1. It takes non-const references, which is appropriate since it modifies rect1's position\n2. It uses a reasonable approach by resolving collision along the axis of minimal overlap\n3. It's focused on a single responsibility (collision resolution)\n\nYou might consider these potential enhancements:\n```cpp\n// Option 1: Return a boolean to indicate if collision occurred\nbool recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        // ... your existing code ...\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Option 2: Create a struct for collision info\nstruct CollisionInfo {\n    bool collided;\n    float overlapX;\n    float overlapY;\n};\n\nCollisionInfo recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2) {\n    CollisionInfo info = {false, 0.0f, 0.0f};\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        // ... your existing code ...\n        info.collided = true;\n        info.overlapX = overlapX;\n        info.overlapY = overlapY;\n    }\n    return info;\n}\n```\n\nBut your current implementation is perfectly valid and useful as is, especially if it meets your specific needs.\ndo you have any idea why im getting this error when trying to compile \nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"RectUtils::handleRecCollision(Rectangle const&, Rectangle const&)\", referenced from:\n      LevelOne::Run() in level_one.cpp.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64\nc++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nmake[2]: *** [polyamn] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nThis linker error typically occurs when you've declared a function but haven't provided its implementation (definition). Based on the error, it seems you've declared `handleRecCollision` in a header file but haven't defined it in any .cpp file.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n1. If you have a header file (e.g., `RectUtils.h`):\n```cpp\nclass RectUtils {\npublic:\n    static void handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n};\n```\n\n2. You need to provide the implementation in a corresponding source file (e.g., `RectUtils.cpp`):\n```cpp\n#include \"RectUtils.h\"\n\nvoid RectUtils::handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n    // Your implementation here\n}\n```\n\nMake sure:\n1. The implementation file (`RectUtils.cpp`) is included in your build system (CMakeLists.txt)\n2. The function signature in the implementation exactly matches the declaration\n3. If it's a member function of a class, use the correct class scope resolution (`RectUtils::`)\n\nIf you're still having issues, check:\n1. Your CMakeLists.txt includes all necessary source files\n2. The function declaration and definition match exactly (including const, reference, etc.)\n3. The function is in the correct namespace/class scope\ni have implemented it take a look\nrect_utilities.h:\n#include \"rect_utilities.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <algorithm>\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\nfloat getRecY(const Rectangle &rec) { return rec.y; }\n// UNDERTAND THIS!!!\nvoid handleRecCollision(Rectangle &rect1, const Rectangle &rect2) {\n  // Calculate overlap on X and Y axes\n  float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                   std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n  float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                   std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n  // Resolve collision based on the axis with the smallest overlap\n  if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n    // Collision on X axis (smaller overlap)\n    if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n      rect1.x -= overlapX; // Move rect1 left by the overlap amount\n    } else {\n      rect1.x += overlapX; // Move rect1 right by the overlap amount\n    }\n  } else {\n    // Collision on Y axis (smaller overlap)\n    if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n      rect1.y -= overlapY; // Move rect1 up by the overlap amount\n    } else {\n      rect1.y += overlapY; // Move rect1 down by the overlap amount\n    }\n  }\n}\nvoid recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX; // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n} // namespace RectUtils\nrect_utilities.cpp:\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec);\n    void handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n    void recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n}\n\nThere are a few issues with your implementation:\n\n1. Your header file (`rect_utilities.h`) contains the implementations, while the source file (`rect_utilities.cpp`) contains the declarations. This should be reversed.\n\n2. You're also including the header file within itself (`#include \"rect_utilities.h\"` at the top of rect_utilities.h).\n\nHere's how it should be structured:\n\n**rect_utilities.h:**\n```cpp\n#pragma once  // or use include guards\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec);\n    void handleRecCollision(Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n    void recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2);\n}\n```\n\n**rect_utilities.cpp:**\n```cpp\n#include \"rect_utilities.h\"\n#include <algorithm>\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec) { \n        return rec.y; \n    }\n\n    void handleRecCollision(Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n        float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                        std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n        float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                        std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n        if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n            if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                rect1.x -= overlapX;\n            } else {\n                rect1.x += overlapX;\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                rect1.y -= overlapY;\n            } else {\n                rect1.y += overlapY;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    void recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2) {\n        if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n            float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                            std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n            float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                            std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n            if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n                if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                    rect1.x -= overlapX;\n                } else {\n                    rect1.x += overlapX;\n                }\n            } else {\n                if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                    rect1.y -= overlapY;\n                } else {\n                    rect1.y += overlapY;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey changes:\n1. Moved implementations to the .cpp file\n2. Kept only declarations in the .h file\n3. Fixed parameter types to match between declaration and definition\n4. Added proper include guards\n5. Removed recursive header inclusion\n\nAlso, make sure your CMakeLists.txt includes both the .cpp and .h files in your build.\nsorry i mistakenly switched up during writing to you the h and cpp files are correct in that sense\n\nAh, I understand now. The issue is likely in the parameter types between your declaration and implementation.\n\nIn your `rect_utilities.cpp`, you're declaring:\n```cpp\nvoid handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n```\n\nBut in your implementation (in the header file), you're using:\n```cpp\nvoid handleRecCollision(Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2)\n```\n\nNotice that `rect1` is `const` in the declaration but non-const in the implementation. These need to match exactly.\n\nSince you're modifying `rect1` in the implementation, you should make the declaration match the implementation by removing the `const` from `rect1` in the declaration:\n\nIn `rect_utilities.cpp`, change to:\n```cpp\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec);\n    void handleRecCollision(Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);  // Remove const from rect1\n    void recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2);\n}\n```\n\nMake sure all function declarations in the .cpp file match exactly with their implementations in the .h file, including const-ness and reference types.\ntake a look at the level_one.cpp file and tell me if you maybe see the root of the issue here \n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"rect_utilities.h\"\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne() :\n    player(),\n    tree1(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree2(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree3(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0}),\n    tree4(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/polyamn/sprites/tree1.png\", {0, 0})\n\n\n    {}\n\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n  BeginDrawing();\n\n  // Update\n  player.Update();\n\n\n  // Collision\n  RectUtils::handleRecCollision(player.GetCollisionBox(), tree1.GetCollisionBox());\n\n\n\n\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n  // We need to prioritize drawing based on objects y axis\n  std::vector<std::pair<float, std::function<void()>>> drawables = {\n      {player.anchorPoint, [&]() { player.Draw(); }},\n              {tree1.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree1.Draw(); }},\n              {tree2.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree2.Draw(); }},\n              {tree3.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree3.Draw(); }},\n              {tree4.GetAnchorPoint(), [&]() { tree4.Draw(); }}\n  };\n  // Sort the vector by the y position (ascending)\n  std::sort(drawables.begin(), drawables.end(),\n      [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {return a.first < b.first;});\n  // Draw in sorted order\n  for (const auto& drawable : drawables){\n      drawable.second();\n  }\n\n  tree2.SetPos({156, 276});\n  tree3.SetPos({758, 50});\n  tree4.SetPos({848, 140});\n\n  EndDrawing();\n}\n\nAh, yes! I can see the issue now. In your `level_one.cpp`, you're passing `const` references returned from the `GetCollisionBox()` methods:\n\n```cpp\nRectUtils::handleRecCollision(player.GetCollisionBox(), tree1.GetCollisionBox());\n```\n\nThis is likely creating a temporary `const` reference, but your `handleRecCollision` function expects a non-const reference for the first parameter because it needs to modify it.\n\nYou need to either:\n\n1. Store the collision box in a modifiable variable first:\n```cpp\nRectangle playerBox = player.GetCollisionBox();\nconst Rectangle treeBox = tree1.GetCollisionBox();\nRectUtils::handleRecCollision(playerBox, treeBox);\n// Then update the player's position based on playerBox if needed\nplayer.SetPosition(playerBox.x, playerBox.y); // or similar\n```\n\nOr:\n\n2. Modify your collision handling approach to update the player's position through a method rather than directly modifying the rectangle:\n```cpp\n// In Player class\nvoid UpdatePosition(float x, float y) {\n    // Update position\n}\n\n// In level_one.cpp\nRectUtils::handleRecCollision(player, tree1); // Modify the function to work with your game objects directly\n```\n\nThe core issue is that you can't modify a temporary value returned by `GetCollisionBox()`. You need to either work with a modifiable copy or restructure your collision handling to work directly with the game objects.\\\n\n\n\nso\n\nso what youre saying is that the get collision box returns a const reference and that is the issue here\nExactly! The issue is that GetCollisionBox() is returning a const Rectangle (or const reference to a Rectangle), which cannot be modified by handleRecCollision() since it needs to adjust the position of rect1.\n\nYou have a few options to fix this:\n\n1. Modify GetCollisionBox() to return a non-const reference:\n```cpp\n// In your Player class\nRectangle& GetCollisionBox() { return collisionBox; }  // Returns modifiable reference\n```\n\n2. Or create a modifiable copy as suggested earlier:\n```cpp\nRectangle playerBox = player.GetCollisionBox();  // Creates a modifiable copy\nRectUtils::handleRecCollision(playerBox, tree1.GetCollisionBox());\n// Then update player position based on the modified playerBox\n```\n\n3. Or redesign the collision handling to work directly with the player object:\n```cpp\nvoid HandleCollision(Player& player, const GameObject& other);\n```\n\nThe key point is that you can't modify a const value or reference, which is what's happening when you try to pass GetCollisionBox()'s return value directly to handleRecCollision().\nbut isnt it weird that produces a linker error or?\nYou're right - the fact that it's producing a linker error rather than a compilation error is unusual for this type of issue. A const/non-const mismatch would typically produce a compilation error.\n\nThe linker error suggests there might be a different problem - specifically that the implementation of `handleRecCollision` isn't being found during the linking phase. \n\nCould you check:\n\n1. The exact function signature in your rect_utilities.h matches what's being called\n2. That rect_utilities.cpp is actually included in your CMakeLists.txt build\n3. That you're not accidentally having multiple declarations in different places\n\nCould you show me your CMakeLists.txt and also confirm that rect_utilities.cpp is definitely being compiled as part of your build?\n\nThe error:\n```\nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"RectUtils::handleRecCollision(Rectangle const&, Rectangle const&)\"\n```\nsuggests that the linker is looking for a function with that exact signature but can't find its implementation anywhere in the compiled code, which points more towards a build system issue or missing implementation rather than just a const-correctness problem.\nmy lsp usually marks out if im not calling stuff properly and in correct scope so isnt it odd that the lsp succesfully recognises im calling handleRecCollision in level one but im getting a linker error. It couldnt be cmake since i have it set up to read both folders where all the newly created files are and the logic works ive also tried rebuilding the project to no avail\nGiven that your Language Server Protocol (LSP) recognizes the function call correctly and you've confirmed that CMake is set up to include all necessary files, the issue might be more subtle. Let's go through a few more checks to ensure everything is correctly set up:\n\n1. **Function Signature Consistency**:\n   Ensure that the function signature in the header file matches exactly with the implementation in the source file.\n\n   **rect_utilities.h**:\n   ```cpp\n   #pragma once\n   #include \"raylib.h\"\n\n   namespace RectUtils {\n       float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec);\n       void handleRecCollision(Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n       void recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2);\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **rect_utilities.cpp**:\n   ```cpp\n   #include \"rect_utilities.h\"\n   #include <algorithm>\n\n   namespace RectUtils {\n       float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec) {\n           return rec.y;\n       }\n\n       void handleRecCollision(Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n           float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                            std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n           float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                            std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n           if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n               if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                   rect1.x -= overlapX;\n               } else {\n                   rect1.x += overlapX;\n               }\n           } else {\n               if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                   rect1.y -= overlapY;\n               } else {\n                   rect1.y += overlapY;\n               }\n           }\n       }\n\n       void recHitboxCollision(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2) {\n           if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n               float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                                std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n               float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                                std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n               if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n                   if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n                       rect1.x -= overlapX;\n                   } else {\n                       rect1.x += overlapX;\n                   }\n               } else {\n                   if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n                       rect1.y -= overlapY;\n                   } else {\n                       rect1.y += overlapY;\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **CMakeLists.txt**:\n   Ensure that `rect_utilities.cpp` is included in your CMakeLists.txt. Here’s a basic example of how it should look:\n\n   ```cmake\n   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\n   project(MyProject)\n\n   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\n\n   include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)\n\n   file(GLOB SOURCES\n       ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp\n       ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/rect_utilities.cpp\n       ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/level_one.cpp\n       # Add other source files here\n   )\n\n   add_executable(MyProject ${SOURCES})\n\n   target_link_libraries(MyProject raylib)  # Link with raylib or other necessary libraries\n   ```\n\n3. **Rebuild the Project**:\n   Sometimes, CMake might not detect changes correctly. Try cleaning and rebuilding the project:\n\n   ```sh\n   cd build\n   make clean\n   cmake ..\n   make\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Definitions**:\n   Ensure there are no multiple definitions or declarations of `handleRecCollision` that might be causing confusion.\n\n5. **Verbose Build Output**:\n   Enable verbose output for your build to see exactly what’s being compiled and linked:\n\n   ```sh\n   make VERBOSE=1\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Typos**:\n   Ensure there are no typos in the function names or namespaces.\n\nIf all these checks are correct and the issue persists, it might be helpful to isolate the problem by creating a minimal reproducible example. This involves creating a small project with just the necessary files to reproduce the linker error. This can help identify if there’s an issue with the project setup or something specific to the code.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3579}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":777},"start":236,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3580}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":778},"start":967,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3581}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":828},"start":1833,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3582}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":829},"start":3280,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3583}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":906},"start":3752,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3584}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":907},"start":4979,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3585}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1084},"start":7222,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3586}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1085},"start":9925,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3587}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1339},"start":10025,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3588}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1340},"start":11125,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3589}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1507},"start":12765,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":3590}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1658},"start":14141,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"The final message must be from the user.
