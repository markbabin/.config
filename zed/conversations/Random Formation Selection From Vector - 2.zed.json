Here's how you can do it:\n\n```cpp\nstd::string getRandomCombo(const std::vector<std::string>& combos) {\n    // Create a random device\n    std::random_device rd;\n    // Create a random number generator\n    std::mt19937 gen(rd());\n    // Create a distribution for the vector's size\n    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(0, combos.size() - 1);\n    \n    // Return a random element from the vector\n    return combos[dis(gen)];\n}\n```\n\nYou would use it like this:\n```cpp\nstd::string randomCombo = getRandomCombo(combos);\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want a simpler (but less random) approach, you could use:\n```cpp\nstd::string getRandomCombo(const std::vector<std::string>& combos) {\n    return combos[rand() % combos.size()];\n}\n```\n\nBut make sure to seed the random number generator once at the start of your program with:\n```cpp\nsrand(time(nullptr));\n```\n\nThe first approach using `std::random_device` and `std::mt19937` is generally recommended as it provides better randomization, but both approaches will work for basic randomization needs.\ngg","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":71}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":669,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":72}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":1792,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":73}}}],"summary":"Random Formation Selection From Vector","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
