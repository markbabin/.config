You have multiple separate objects with the same \"context\": \"Editor\", which might cause conflicts. Try combining the Editor bindings into a single object like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Workspace\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      // \"shift shift\": \"file_finder::Toggle\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      // \"j k\": [\"workspace::SendKeystrokes\", \"escape\"],\n      \"cmd right\": [\"workspace::ActivatePaneInDirection\", \"Right\"],\n      \"cmd left\": [\"workspace::ActivatePaneInDirection\", \"Left\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis consolidates all Editor keybindings into a single object, which should resolve any potential conflicts. Also, make sure that:\n\n1. You're using the correct syntax for the key combinations (cmd right and cmd left should be correct)\n2. There are no conflicting keybindings in the default keymap\n3. You've saved the keymap file and reloaded Zed (if necessary)\n\nIf it still doesn't work, you might want to:\n1. Check the Zed logs for any error messages\n2. Verify that the command names are correct\n3. Try using alternative syntax like \"cmd+right\" instead of \"cmd right\" (though the space format should work)\nshould i put it under editor when it says workspace::aCtivate\nAh, good observation! Since these commands are workspace-related operations (ActivatePaneInDirection), they should indeed be under the \"Workspace\" context rather than \"Editor\". Here's the corrected version:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Workspace\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      // \"shift shift\": \"file_finder::Toggle\",\n      \"cmd right\": [\"workspace::ActivatePaneInDirection\", \"Right\"],\n      \"cmd left\": [\"workspace::ActivatePaneInDirection\", \"Left\"]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"context\": \"Editor\",\n    \"bindings\": {\n      // \"j k\": [\"workspace::SendKeystrokes\", \"escape\"]\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis makes more sense since you're trying to control workspace-level navigation between panes. Try this version and it should work better!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":90}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":753,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":91}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":23},"start":1961,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":92}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":77},"start":2023,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":93}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":78},"start":2741,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":94}}}],"summary":"Zed Editor Keybinding Configuration Issues","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
