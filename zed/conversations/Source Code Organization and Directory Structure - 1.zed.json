The folders are getting crowdded and its becoming more and more chaotic should I separate them even more?\nYes, separating files into more specific subdirectories is a good practice as your project grows. Here's a suggested directory structure:\n\n```\n/polyamn\n├── build/\n├── inc/\n│   ├── core/           (core game systems)\n│   ├── entities/       (game objects, characters)\n│   ├── graphics/       (rendering, animations)\n│   ├── audio/         (sound-related headers)\n│   ├── utils/         (utility functions, helpers)\n│   └── ui/            (user interface elements)\n│\n├── src/\n│   ├── core/\n│   ├── entities/\n│   ├── graphics/\n│   ├── audio/\n│   ├── utils/\n│   └── ui/\n│\n└── assets/            (game resources)\n    ├── textures/\n    ├── sounds/\n    └── fonts/\n```\n\nBenefits of this approach:\n1. Better organization\n2. Easier to find files\n3. Clearer separation of concerns\n4. More maintainable as project grows\n5. Easier for other developers to understand the codebase\n\nMake sure to update your build system (CMake, Makefile, etc.) to handle the new directory structure.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":73}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":43},"start":251,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":74}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":44},"start":1361,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":75}}}],"summary":"Source Code Organization and Directory Structure","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
