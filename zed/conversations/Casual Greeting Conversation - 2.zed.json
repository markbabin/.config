How can I assist you today?\nzed is giving me an error for all the Raylib color declarations as in RAYWHITE it highlights it red and says this Expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction why?\n\nIt sounds like you're encountering an issue with the way you're using Raylib's color constants in your code. The error message you're seeing suggests that the compiler is expecting a different syntax. Here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Include the Raylib Header:**\n   Make sure you have included the Raylib header file at the beginning of your source file:\n   ```c\n   #include \"raylib.h\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct Usage of Color Constants:**\n   Ensure that you are using the color constants correctly. Raylib defines several color constants such as `RAYWHITE`, `RED`, `GREEN`, etc. These should be used directly without any additional syntax. For example:\n   ```c\n   ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Typographical Errors:**\n   Verify that there are no typographical errors in your code. The color constants should be written in uppercase and without any additional characters or spaces.\n\n4. **Compiler Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that your compiler is compatible with Raylib and that you are using the correct version of Raylib. Some older or non-standard compilers might not handle certain syntax correctly.\n\n5. **Example Code:**\n   Here is a simple example of a Raylib program that uses color constants correctly:\n   ```c\n   #include \"raylib.h\"\n\n   int main(void)\n   {\n       // Initialization\n       //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       const int screenWidth = 800;\n       const int screenHeight = 450;\n\n       InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, \"Raylib Example - Basic Window\");\n\n       SetTargetFPS(60);               // Set our game to run at 60 frames-per-second\n       //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       // Main game loop\n       while (!WindowShouldClose())    // Detect window close button or ESC key\n       {\n           // Update\n           //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           // TODO: Update your variables here\n           //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           // Draw\n           //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           BeginDrawing();\n\n           ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n\n           DrawText(\"Congrats! You created your first window!\", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);\n\n           EndDrawing();\n           //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       }\n\n       // De-Initialization\n       //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       CloseWindow();        // Close window and OpenGL context\n       //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\nIf you are still encountering issues, please provide more details about your development environment (e.g., operating system, compiler, Raylib version) and the specific code that is causing the error. This will help in diagnosing the problem more accurately.\nhow would i reinstall raylib and make sure its the newest version\n\nReinstalling Raylib and ensuring you have the latest version depends on your operating system and the method you used to install it initially.

Add -std=c++11\"\nThe error message you're seeing indicates that your compiler is set to use an older version of the C++ standard, and Raylib requires at least C++11. You need to update your compiler settings to use C++11 or later.\n\nHere's how you can do that depending on your development environment:\n\n### Command Line (GCC/Clang)\n\nIf you're compiling your code using the command line with `gcc` or `clang`, you can add the `-std=c++11` flag to your compilation command:\n\n```sh\ngcc -o example example.c -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11 -std=c++11\n```\n\nOr if you're using `clang`:\n\n```sh\nclang -o example example.c -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11 -std=c++11\n```\n\n### CMake\n\nIf you're using CMake to manage your build process, you can specify the C++ standard in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)\nproject(example)\n\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\n\nadd_executable(example example.c)\ntarget_link_libraries(example raylib GL m pthread dl rt X11)\n```\n\n### Visual Studio\n\nIf you're using Visual Studio, you can set the C++ standard version in the project properties:\n\n1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select \"Properties\".\n2. Go to \"Configuration Properties\" -> \"C/C++\" -> \"Language\".\n3. Set the \"C++ Language Standard\" to \"ISO C++11 Standard (/std:c++11)\" or later.\n\n### Xcode\n\nIf you're using Xcode, you can set the C++ standard version in the project settings:\n\n1. Open your project in Xcode.\n2. Go to the \"Build Settings\" tab.\n3. Search for \"C++ Language Dialect\".\n4. Set it to \"C++11\" or later.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere is an example of a simple Raylib program that you can use to test your setup:\n\n```c\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    const int screenWidth = 800;\n    const int screenHeight = 450;\n\n    InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, \"Raylib Example - Basic Window\");\n\n    SetTargetFPS(60);\n\n    while (!WindowShouldClose())\n    {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawText(\"Congrats! You created your first window!\", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY);\n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n\n    CloseWindow();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nCompile and run the program using the appropriate method for your environment to ensure everything is working correctly.
