Here are some common reasons and solutions:\n\n1. If GameOverScreen is a function:\n```cpp\n// In header file (.h)\nvoid GameOverScreen(); // Declaration\n\n// In source file (.cpp)\nvoid GameOverScreen() { // Definition\n    // Implementation here\n}\n```\n\n2. If GameOverScreen is a class:\n```cpp\n// In header file (.h)\nclass GameOverScreen {\npublic:\n    GameOverScreen(); // Constructor declaration\n    // other members...\n};\n\n// In source file (.cpp)\nGameOverScreen::GameOverScreen() { // Constructor definition\n    // Implementation here\n}\n```\n\nCommon fixes:\n1. Make sure the GameOverScreen implementation file (.cpp) is included in your build\n2. Check your CMakeLists.txt to ensure all necessary source files are listed\n3. Verify the function/class is properly defined\n4. Check for typos in the declaration vs definition\n\nCan you share:\n1. How GameOverScreen is declared\n2. Where it's defined\n3. Your CMakeLists.txt content\n\nThis will help identify the exact issue.\nthis is my .cpp file\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n   BeginDrawing();\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n  EndDrawing();\n\n\n\n}\nand my .h file\n#pragma once\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen();\n\nThe code looks correct in terms of declaration and definition. The issue might be with how the files are being compiled and linked. Please check your CMakeLists.txt file.\n\nMake sure your CMakeLists.txt includes both the main.cpp and gameover.cpp files. It should look something like this:\n\n```cmake\nadd_executable(your_project_name\n    main.cpp\n    gameover.cpp\n    # other source files...\n)\n```\n\nIf your gameover.cpp file isn't listed in CMakeLists.txt, the linker won't be able to find the GameOverScreen() function definition.\n\nAlso, double check:\n1. The file names match exactly (case-sensitive)\n2. The files are in the correct directories\n3. All source files are properly listed in CMakeLists.txt\n\nCan you share your CMakeLists.txt content? That would help identify the issue.\n\nIf your gameover.cpp file is in a different directory, make sure the path in CMakeLists.txt is correct relative to the project root.\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)\nproject(reasings)\n\n# Enable compilation database for IDEs and tools\nset(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)\n\n# Set C++ standard\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\n\n# Add include and library directories\ninclude_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)\nlink_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)\n\n# Add source and header files\nfile(GLOB SOURCES ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)\nfile(GLOB HEADERS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/inc/*.h)\n\n# Add the executable with both sources and headers\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})\n\n# Add include directory explicitly\ntarget_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/inc)\n\n# Link the Raylib library\ntarget_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} raylib)\n\n# Platform-specific settings for Raylib\nif(APPLE)\n    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} \"-framework OpenGL\" \"-framework Cocoa\" \"-framework IOKit\" \"-framework CoreVideo\")\nelseif(UNIX)\n    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} m pthread dl rt X11)\nendif()\n\nI notice you're using GLOB to collect source files, and your directory structure seems to have specific folders for source and header files (`src` and `inc`). Make sure your files are in the correct directories:\n\n1. Your `gameover.cpp` should be in the `src` directory\n2. Your `gameover.h` should be in the `inc` directory\n\nIf your files are not in these directories, the GLOB command won't find them. You can verify this by:\n\n1. First, check your directory structure:\n```\nproject_root/\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.cpp\n│   ├── gameover.cpp    # Must be here\n│   └── ...\n├── inc/\n│   ├── gameover.h      # Must be here\n│   └── ...\n└── CMakeLists.txt\n```\n\n2. If your files are in different locations, either:\n   \n   A. Move them to the correct directories, or\n   \n   B. Modify your CMakeLists.txt to include the actual file locations:\n```cmake\n# Instead of GLOB, explicitly list your source files\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}\n    src/main.cpp\n    src/gameover.cpp\n    # other source files...\n)\n```\n\nAlso, for debugging purposes, you can print the files that GLOB finds:\n```cmake\nfile(GLOB SOURCES ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)\nmessage(\"Found source files: ${SOURCES}\")\nfile(GLOB HEADERS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/inc/*.h)\nmessage(\"Found header files: ${HEADERS}\")\n```\n\nThis will show you which files CMake is actually including in the build.\nmy main.cpp\n\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"title_screen.h\"\n#include \"game.h\"\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n\n\n\nint main(void){\n\n\nInitWindow(screen_width, screen_height, \"newGame\");\nSetTargetFPS(120);\nGame game;\n\nwhile (!WindowShouldClose()){\n    if (currentGameState == TITLE_SCREEN){\n        TitleScreen();\n    } else if (currentGameState == GAME){\n        game.Run();\n    } else if (currentGameState == GAMEOVER){\n        GameOverScreen();\n    }\n}\n}\nmy gameover.cpp \n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n   BeginDrawing();\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n  EndDrawing();\n\n\n\n}\nmy gameover.h\n#pragma once\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen();\n\ncan you spot why its giving this error \n\n[ 20%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/reasings.dir/src/main.cpp.o\n[ 40%] Linking CXX executable reasings\nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"GameOverScreen()\", referenced from:\n      _main in main.cpp.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64\nc++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nmake[2]: *** [reasings] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/reasings.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nFrom the build output, I can see that only main.cpp is being compiled (`Building CXX object CMakeFiles/reasings.dir/src/main.cpp.o`), but gameover.cpp is not being compiled. This means CMake isn't finding your gameover.cpp file.\n\nBased on your CMakeLists.txt and the error, make sure:\n\n1. Your gameover.cpp is actually in the `src` directory\n2. Your gameover.h is in the `inc` directory\n\nYour directory structure should look like this:\n```\nproject_root/\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.cpp\n│   └── gameover.cpp    # Must be here!\n├── inc/\n│   └── gameover.h      # Must be here!\n└── CMakeLists.txt\n```\n\nTo debug this:\n\n1. First, verify your file locations are correct\n2. You can temporarily modify your CMakeLists.txt to explicitly list the files:\n\n```cmake\n# Replace the GLOB with explicit files\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}\n    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main.cpp\n    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/gameover.cpp  # Make sure this path is correct\n)\n```\n\n3. Or add a debug message to see what files GLOB is finding:\n```cmake\nfile(GLOB SOURCES ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp)\nmessage(\"Found source files: ${SOURCES}\")\n```\n\nIf your gameover.cpp is not in the src directory, the GLOB won't find it and it won't be compiled, leading to this linker error.\nhow to rebuild my build\nTo rebuild your project from scratch, you'll need to:\n\n1. First, delete the old build files. From your project root directory:\n```bash\n# Remove the build directory\nrm -rf build\n\n# Create a new build directory\nmkdir build\ncd build\n\n# Run CMake again\ncmake ..\n\n# Build the project\nmake\n```\n\nOr as a single command sequence:\n```bash\nrm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make\n```\n\nIf you're using an IDE like VS Code, you might also want to:\n1. Close the IDE\n2. Delete the build directory\n3. Reopen the IDE\n4. Rebuild\n\nThis ensures you're starting fresh with no cached build files that might be causing issues.\n\nIf you still get errors after rebuilding, double-check that:\n1. gameover.cpp is in the src directory\n2. gameover.h is in the inc directory\n3. All file paths in your CMakeLists.txt are correct\ni have this class for button and wnat to create another button here (im calling this in the main game loop)\n\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n   BeginDrawing();\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n  EndDrawing();\n\n\n\n}\n\nHere's how you can add buttons to your GameOverScreen. I'll show you two approaches:\n\n1. Using a simple rectangle button:\n```cpp\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n#include \"globals.h\" // assuming this has your game state enum\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n    // Define button dimensions\n    Rectangle playAgainBtn = { screen_width/2 - 100, screen_height/2, 200, 50 };\n    Rectangle quitBtn = { screen_width/2 - 100, screen_height/2 + 70, 200, 50 };\n\n    BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n\n        // Draw and handle Play Again button\n        if (CheckCollisionPointRec(GetMousePosition(), playAgainBtn)) {\n            DrawRectangleRec(playAgainBtn, GRAY);\n            if (IsMouseButtonPressed(MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT)) {\n                currentGameState = GAME; // Reset to game state\n            }\n        } else {\n            DrawRectangleRec(playAgainBtn, DARKGRAY);\n        }\n        DrawText(\"Play Again\", playAgainBtn.x + 50, playAgainBtn.y + 15, 20, WHITE);\n\n        // Draw and handle Quit button\n        if (CheckCollisionPointRec(GetMousePosition(), quitBtn)) {\n            DrawRectangleRec(quitBtn, GRAY);\n            if (IsMouseButtonPressed(MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT)) {\n                CloseWindow();\n            }\n        } else {\n            DrawRectangleRec(quitBtn, DARKGRAY);\n        }\n        DrawText(\"Quit\", quitBtn.x + 80, quitBtn.y + 15, 20, WHITE);\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\n2. Or if you have a Button class:\n```cpp\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n#include \"Button.h\" // Your button class\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n    // Create buttons\n    Button playAgainButton(screen_width/2 - 100, screen_height/2, 200, 50, \"Play Again\");\n    Button quitButton(screen_width/2 - 100, screen_height/2 + 70, 200, 50, \"Quit\");\n\n    BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n\n        // Handle Play Again button\n        if (playAgainButton.IsClicked()) {\n            currentGameState = GAME;\n        }\n        playAgainButton.Draw();\n\n        // Handle Quit button\n        if (quitButton.IsClicked()) {\n            CloseWindow();\n        }\n        quitButton.Draw();\n\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nKey points:\n1. The buttons are positioned relative to screen width/height\n2. Each button has hover effects\n3. Clicking triggers different actions\n4. You might want to add sound effects for button clicks\n5. Consider adding button textures instead of plain rectangles\n6. You might want to unload the texture when leaving the screen\n\nRemember to:\n1. Include necessary headers\n2. Define screen_width and screen_height if not already defined\n3. Handle memory management for textures\n4. Add appropriate error checking\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show how to implement specific features?\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n#include \"button.h\"\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n   Button playAgainButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/playagain.png\", 0, 0, screen_height);\n   BeginDrawing();\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n  EndDrawing();\n\n\n\n}\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n#include \"button.h\"\n\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n   Button playAgainButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/playagain.png\", 0, 0, screen_height);\n   BeginDrawing();\n  ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n  DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n  EndDrawing();\n\n\n\n}\nwhy isnt the button visible on screen \nThe button isn't visible because you need to call the button's Draw method, and you should position it appropriately on the screen. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"globals.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"gameover.h\"\n#include \"button.h\"\n\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n    // Position the button in the middle of the screen (adjust x and y as needed)\n    Button playAgainButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/playagain.png\", \n                          screen_width/2 - 100,  // x position\n                          screen_height/2,       // y position\n                          screen_height);        // height\n\n    BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n        playAgainButton.Draw();  // Add this line to draw the button\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nKey changes:\n1. Added `playAgainButton.Draw()` to actually render the button\n2. Adjusted the button position (x, y coordinates) to place it in a visible area\n3. Make sure the button's coordinates are within the screen bounds\n\nAlso, you might want to:\n1. Check if the button is clicked\n2. Add hover effects\n3. Handle button state changes\n\nExample with button interaction:\n```cpp\nvoid GameOverScreen(){\n    Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/gameover.png\");\n\n    if (texture.id == 0){\n        std::cout << \"Gameover texture failed\" << std::endl;\n        CloseWindow();\n    }\n\n    Button playAgainButton(\"/Users/markbabin/CODE/raylib_projects/pong2/sprites/playagain.png\", \n                          screen_width/2 - 100,\n                          screen_height/2,\n                          screen_height);\n\n    BeginDrawing();\n        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n        DrawTexture(texture, 0, 0, WHITE);\n        \n        playAgainButton.Draw();\n        \n        // Check for button click\n        if (playAgainButton.IsClicked()) {\n            currentGameState = GAME;  // Or whatever action you want\n        }\n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\nwill raylib prioritize the firstly declared ","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1827}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":444,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1828}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":1517,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1829}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":119},"start":2008,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1830}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":120},"start":2924,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1831}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":177},"start":3921,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1832}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":178},"start":5310,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1833}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":453},"start":6745,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1834}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":454},"start":8019,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1835}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":627},"start":8043,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1836}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":628},"start":8861,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1837}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":894},"start":9387,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1838}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":895},"start":12695,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1839}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1404},"start":13884,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1840}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1405},"start":16141,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1841}}}],"summary":"C++ Linker Error GameOverScreen Missing","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
