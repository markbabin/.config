Specifically, the linker is complaining that it cannot find the definition of the function `RectUtils::handleRecCollision(Rectangle const&, Rectangle const&)`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the error message:\n\n1. **\"RectUtils::handleRecCollision(Rectangle const&, Rectangle const&)\", referenced from: LevelOne::Run() in level_one.cpp.o**:\n   - This indicates that the function `RectUtils::handleRecCollision` is being called from the `LevelOne::Run()` method in the `level_one.cpp` file.\n   - The linker is unable to find the definition of this function.\n\n2. **ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64**:\n   - The linker is specifically looking for symbols (in this case, the `handleRecCollision` function) for the `arm64` architecture, which is common for Apple Silicon Macs.\n\n3. **c++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)**:\n   - The linker command failed, and it suggests using the `-v` flag to get more detailed output.\n\n4. **make[2]: *** [polyamn] Error 1**:\n   - The `make` tool encountered an error while trying to build the target `polyamn`.\n\n5. **make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/all] Error 2**:\n   - The `make` tool encountered an error in one of its subcommands.\n\n6. **make: *** [all] Error 2**:\n   - The `make` tool encountered an error while trying to build all targets.\n\n### Possible Causes and Solutions\n\n1. **Missing Definition**:\n   - Ensure that the function `RectUtils::handleRecCollision` is defined in one of your source files. You might have declared the function in a header file but forgot to provide its definition in a corresponding `.cpp` file.\n\n2. **Incorrect Linkage**:\n   - Make sure that the source file containing the definition of `RectUtils::handleRecCollision` is being compiled and linked. Check your `CMakeLists.txt` or `Makefile` to ensure that all necessary source files are included.\n\n3. **Typographical Errors**:\n   - Double-check the function signature in both the declaration and definition to ensure they match exactly. Even a small difference can cause the linker to fail.\n\n4. **Namespace Issues**:\n   - Ensure that the function definition is in the correct namespace. If `RectUtils` is a namespace, make sure the function is defined within it.\n\n5. **Library Linking**:\n   - If `RectUtils::handleRecCollision` is part of an external library, make sure that the library is correctly linked in your project. You might need to add the library to your `CMakeLists.txt` or `Makefile`.\n\n### Example\n\nIf `RectUtils::handleRecCollision` is declared in a header file `RectUtils.h` like this:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    void handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n}\n```\n\nMake sure it is defined in a corresponding source file `RectUtils.cpp`:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"RectUtils.h\"\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    void handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n        // Function implementation\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd ensure that `RectUtils.cpp` is included in your build system configuration (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt` or `Makefile`).\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the linker error and successfully build your project.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":408,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":3799,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}}],"summary":"Linker Error in C++ Project","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
