You have a few options for handling the player between scenes:\n\n1. Create a new player instance in your first level class (simplest but player state won't persist):\n\n```cpp\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player player;  // Just like in GameMenu\n    \npublic:\n    LevelOne() : player() { }\n    \n    void Run() {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        \n        player.Update();\n        // Rest of level logic...\n        \n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n2. Pass the existing player as a reference/pointer (better for maintaining player state):\n\n```cpp\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player& player;  // Reference to existing player\n    \npublic:\n    LevelOne(Player& existingPlayer) : player(existingPlayer) { }\n    \n    void Run() {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        \n        player.Update();\n        // Rest of level logic...\n        \n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n3. Use a shared pointer or global player instance (if you need to access the player from multiple places):\n\n```cpp\n// In globals.h or similar\nextern Player* globalPlayer;  // or std::shared_ptr<Player>\n\nclass LevelOne {\npublic:\n    void Run() {\n        BeginDrawing();\n        \n        globalPlayer->Update();\n        // Rest of level logic...\n        \n        EndDrawing();\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThe second approach (passing the player as a reference) is generally recommended as it:\n- Maintains player state between scenes\n- Makes dependencies explicit\n- Avoids global variables\n- Gives you more control over object lifetime\n\nExample usage with the second approach:\n\n```cpp\n// In your game manager or main loop:\nPlayer player;\nGameMenu gameMenu(player);\nLevelOne levelOne(player);\n\n// When switching scenes:\nswitch(currentGameState) {\n    case MENU:\n        gameMenu.Run();\n        break;\n    case SCENE1:\n        levelOne.Run();\n        break;\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the same player instance is used across different scenes, maintaining its state (position, health, inventory, etc.) as you transition between levels.\nfor this new level class should i make an cpp file also or just an h file\n\nIt's generally good practice to separate the declaration (header .h file) and implementation (.cpp file) of your class. This approach:\n\n1. Improves code organization\n2. Reduces compilation time\n3. Follows the separation of concerns principle\n4. Makes the code more maintainable\n\nSo you should create both:\n\n`level_one.h`:\n```cpp\n#ifndef LEVEL_ONE_H\n#define LEVEL_ONE_H\n\n#include \"player.h\"\n\nclass LevelOne {\nprivate:\n    Player& player;\n    // Other level-specific members\n\npublic:\n    LevelOne(Player& existingPlayer);\n    void Run();\n};\n\n#endif\n```\n\n`level_one.cpp`:\n```cpp\n#include \"level_one.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nLevelOne::LevelOne(Player& existingPlayer) : player(existingPlayer) {\n    // Constructor implementation\n}\n\nvoid LevelOne::Run() {\n    BeginDrawing();\n    \n    // Update\n    player.Update();\n    \n    // Draw\n    ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);\n    player.Draw();\n    // Other level-specific drawing/logic\n    \n    EndDrawing();\n}\n```\n\nHaving both files makes your code more organized and easier to maintain in the long run, especially as your level grows more complex with additional features and functionality.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":106}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":36},"start":914,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":107}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":37},"start":2988,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":108}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":93},"start":3063,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":109}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":94},"start":4189,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":110}}}],"summary":"Player Object Reuse Across Game Levels","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
