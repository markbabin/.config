Each function has its own scope, so the parameter names are independent of each other and won't conflict, even if they're identical.\n\nThis is perfectly valid:\n```cpp\nvoid handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\nvoid recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n```\n\nThe parameter names only need to be unique within each function's scope. They can be reused across different functions without any issues. In fact, using consistent parameter names across related functions can make your code more readable and maintainable, especially when the parameters represent similar things.\nvoid recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX; // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nis it okay to create a rec utilty function like this \nYes, it's perfectly fine and actually a good practice to create utility functions like this for handling rectangle collision resolution. This function implements a basic Minimum Translation Vector (MTV) approach for collision resolution, which is a common technique.\n\nA few observations about your implementation:\n1. It takes non-const references, which is appropriate since it modifies rect1's position\n2. It uses a reasonable approach by resolving collision along the axis of minimal overlap\n3. It's focused on a single responsibility (collision resolution)\n\nYou might consider these potential enhancements:\n```cpp\n// Option 1: Return a boolean to indicate if collision occurred\nbool recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2) {\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        // ... your existing code ...\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Option 2: Create a struct for collision info\nstruct CollisionInfo {\n    bool collided;\n    float overlapX;\n    float overlapY;\n};\n\nCollisionInfo recHitboxCollision(Rectangle &rect1, Rectangle &rect2) {\n    CollisionInfo info = {false, 0.0f, 0.0f};\n    if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n        // ... your existing code ...\n        info.collided = true;\n        info.overlapX = overlapX;\n        info.overlapY = overlapY;\n    }\n    return info;\n}\n```\n\nBut your current implementation is perfectly valid and useful as is, especially if it meets your specific needs.\ndo you have any idea why im getting this error when trying to compile \nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"RectUtils::handleRecCollision(Rectangle const&, Rectangle const&)\", referenced from:\n      LevelOne::Run() in level_one.cpp.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64\nc++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nmake[2]: *** [polyamn] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/polyamn.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nThis linker error typically occurs when you've declared a function but haven't provided its implementation (definition). Based on the error, it seems you've declared `handleRecCollision` in a header file but haven't defined it in any .cpp file.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n1. If you have a header file (e.g., `RectUtils.h`):\n```cpp\nclass RectUtils {\npublic:\n    static void handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n};\n```\n\n2. You need to provide the implementation in a corresponding source file (e.g., `RectUtils.cpp`):\n```cpp\n#include \"RectUtils.h\"\n\nvoid RectUtils::handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2) {\n    // Your implementation here\n}\n```\n\nMake sure:\n1. The implementation file (`RectUtils.cpp`) is included in your build system (CMakeLists.txt)\n2. The function signature in the implementation exactly matches the declaration\n3. If it's a member function of a class, use the correct class scope resolution (`RectUtils::`)\n\nIf you're still having issues, check:\n1. Your CMakeLists.txt includes all necessary source files\n2. The function declaration and definition match exactly (including const, reference, etc.)\n3. The function is in the correct namespace/class scope\ni have implemented it take a look\nrect_utilities.h:\n#include \"rect_utilities.h\"\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n#include <algorithm>\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\nfloat getRecY(const Rectangle &rec) { return rec.y; }\n// UNDERTAND THIS!!!\nvoid handleRecCollision(Rectangle &rect1, const Rectangle &rect2) {\n  // Calculate overlap on X and Y axes\n  float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                   std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n  float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                   std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n  // Resolve collision based on the axis with the smallest overlap\n  if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n    // Collision on X axis (smaller overlap)\n    if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n      rect1.x -= overlapX; // Move rect1 left by the overlap amount\n    } else {\n      rect1.x += overlapX; // Move rect1 right by the overlap amount\n    }\n  } else {\n    // Collision on Y axis (smaller overlap)\n    if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n      rect1.y -= overlapY; // Move rect1 up by the overlap amount\n    } else {\n      rect1.y += overlapY; // Move rect1 down by the overlap amount\n    }\n  }\n}\nvoid recHitboxCollision( Rectangle &rect1,  Rectangle &rect2) {\n\n  if (CheckCollisionRecs(rect1, rect2)) {\n    float overlapX = std::min(rect1.x + rect1.width, rect2.x + rect2.width) -\n                     std::max(rect1.x, rect2.x);\n    float overlapY = std::min(rect1.y + rect1.height, rect2.y + rect2.height) -\n                     std::max(rect1.y, rect2.y);\n\n    // Resolve collision on the axis of smaller overlap\n    if (overlapX < overlapY) {\n      if (rect1.x < rect2.x) {\n        rect1.x -= overlapX; // Push player back to the left\n      } else {\n        rect1.x += overlapX; // Push player back to the right\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (rect1.y < rect2.y) {\n        rect1.y -= overlapY; // Push rect1 back up\n      } else {\n        rect1.y += overlapY; // Push player back down\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n} // namespace RectUtils\nrect_utilities.cpp:\n#include \"raylib.h\"\n\nnamespace RectUtils {\n    float getRecY(const Rectangle& rec);\n    void handleRecCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n    void recHitboxCollision(const Rectangle& rect1, const Rectangle& rect2);\n}\n\nThere are a few issues with your implementation:\n\n1.
