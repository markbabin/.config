You may have commits on the remote that aren’t in your local repository. Common reasons include:\n\n• You committed changes locally without pulling the latest changes from GitHub.  \n• Someone else pushed newer commits to the remote branch.  \n• There is a merge conflict that Git can’t resolve automatically.\n\nHere are some steps to help resolve the issue:\n\n1) Make sure you’re on the correct branch:\n   git checkout main\n   (replace \"main\" with your branch name if it’s something else)\n\n2) Update your local copy by syncing with the remote:\n   git pull origin main --rebase\n   or\n   git pull origin main  \n   (If you use the --rebase flag, Git will reapply your local commits on top of the new changes from remote.)\n\n3) Resolve any merge/rebase conflicts if they occur. If Git prompts you to fix conflicts, open each conflicted file, decide which changes to keep, then add and commit those resolved files.\n\n4) Once everything is merged and clean, push your changes:\n   git push origin main\n\nIf you need to force your changes (be cautious with this—force pushing can overwrite others’ work on the remote), you can do:\n   git push origin main --force\n\nHowever, use git push --force only if you’re certain your local work should become the definitive version on GitHub, as it overwrites the remote branch history.\n\nIn most cases, correcting the local vs. remote mismatch with a normal pull (and merge or rebase) then pushing again is sufficient to resolve the error.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":13},"start":142,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":47}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":1739,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":48}}}],"summary":"Resolving Git Push Errors","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
