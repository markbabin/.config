Here's the solution:\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() void {\n    var n: u32 = 2;\n\n    // The loop will continue while n is less than or equal to 1024\n    while (n <= 1024) {\n        // Print the current number\n        std.debug.print(\"{} \", .{n});\n\n        // Set n to n multiplied by 2\n        n *= 2;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe condition `n <= 1024` means:\n- The loop will continue as long as n is less than or equal to 1024\n- Once n becomes greater than 1024, the loop will stop\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print:\n`2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024`\n\nEach number is double the previous number, and the sequence stops when it reaches 1024.\n\nYou could also write the condition as `n < 2048` or any other way that achieves the same result, but `n <= 1024` is probably the most straightforward solution.\nin zig you can set up a continue expression in the while loop to continue until the condition is met. lets look at this example \n//     while (foo < 10) : (foo += 2) {\n//         // Do something with even numbers less than 10...\n//     }\nwouldnt ","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":109}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":317,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":110}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":1232,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":111}}}],"summary":"Calculate to 1024 Loop","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
